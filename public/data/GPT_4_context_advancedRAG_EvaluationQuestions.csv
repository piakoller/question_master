Two of 111 (1,8%)\npatients given ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE developed myelodysplastic\nsyndrome, one of whom died 33 months after randomization\n(this person was the only reported ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE treatment-\nrelated death).

The classi ﬁcation of NENs\nhas recently been updated by the WHO according to morphology\nand proliferation as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors\n(NETs) (G1 to G3) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs) (G3) ( Table 2 )(3).\nNETs may be clinically silent ( ‘non-functioning ’) or may\nsynthesize and secrete a variety of peptides and neuroamines\nwhich lead to the development of characteristic clinical\nsyndromes, including carcinoid syndrome and functional\npancreatic tumors such as insulinoma (hypoglycemia) and\ngastrinoma (gastric hyperacidity).

NETss tend to be indolent in\ncharacter and patients can still live for relatively prolonged\nperiods with good quality of life even with metastatic disease ( 4).\nThe incidence of NENs is increasing year-on-year. In the\nUSA, the SEER database has documented a 6,4-fold increase in\nincidence between 2007 (1,09 per 100.000) and 2012 (6,98 per\n100.000) ( 5). This increase has included gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs with the highest incidence being seen in adults\naged 74-80) ( 6) The age-standardized incidence rate of NENs in\nthe UK between 2013-2015 has been reported as 8.6 per 100,000,\nwith an incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 for gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs ( 7).\nGEP-NETs are graded with increasing aggressivity as G1, G2\nor G3, based on Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count and\nhistological differentiation ( Table 2 )(3). Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease.

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 6 of 15\nMore recently , some studies have investigated the role of PRRT in high-grade (G3, Ki-67\n> 20%) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms, called NEN G3. NEN G3\nincluded well differentiated tumor (NET G3) and poorly differentiated (Neuroendocrine\ncarcinoma, NEC), as described in the 2017 WHO classification for pancreatic NEN [ 17], with a\nsimilar expansion to gastrointestinal G3 tumors anticipated in the next WHO classification. In\na study population of 19 well differentiated grade 3 NETs [ 9], a mean overall survival time of\n38 months was observed. Other studies, including both NET G3, and NEC, have suggested a\nbenefit on clinical outcome [ 18–20]. Particularly , in a multicenter retrospective study including\n149 patients with GEP NEN G3, PRRT demonstrates promising response rates, disease control\nrates, PFS and OS [ 19]68Ga-SSTR PET/CT and 18FDG PET/CT may also help to select the\nNET G3 patients who might benefit from PRRT. Indeed, a high SUV on SSTR PET/CT and no\nor minor 18F-FDG avidity appeared to be associated with a better prognosis [18].\n4.2. Pancreatic NET\nIn pancreatic NETs, the effects are not conﬁrmed by a controlled randomized Phase III\nstudy (Table 2). Available data consist of multiple single-arm prospective and retrospective\ntrials. A Retrospective study series of 68 patients treated for pancreatic NET and having\nreceived four cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE at 8 GBq showed no beneﬁt in terms of survival\nin patients ( n= 35) treated with PRRT on the front line [ 21]. On the other hand, signals\nin favor of an efﬁciency are identiﬁed. In this cohort a disease control rate of 85% and a\nmedian time to progression of 34 months was observed [6].\nOther retrospective studies argue for efficacy in disease control and low toxicity of PRRT\nin pancreatic NETs. A retrospective series of 443 gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary\nneuroendocrine tumours, including 133 pancreatic NETs, showed a disease control rate of\n84% and an objective response rate of 54% in the pancreatic tumour subgroup. The median\nprogression-free survival was 30 months and overall survival was 71 months in this subgroup.\nShort-term tolerability was marked by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (related to the\nprior infusion of amino acids during the177Lu DOTATATE treatment to decrease absorption,\nand thus toxicity , in the kidney). No short-term hematotoxicity or renal toxicity was found in\nthis series. Long-term toxicity was marked by four cases of acute leukemia (0.7% of the study\npopulation) and nine cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (1.5%). [10].\nA meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of PRRT with177Lu DOTATATE and everolimus\n(one of the therapeutic alternatives to PRRT in gastroenteropancreatic NET not accessible\nto surgical treatment) compared 15 articles reporting 697 patients treated with PRRT and\n12 articles reporting 946 patients treated with everolimus. The objective response rate was\nhigher with PRRT compared to everolimus (47% vs. 12% respectively , p< 0.001), as was the\nrate of disease control (81% vs. 73% respectively, p< 0.001), and progression-free survival\n(25.7 months vs. 14.7 months respectively , p< 0.001). The tolerance profile was also better with\nPRRT than everolimus. Grade 3/4 hematotoxicity was found in 5% of cases with PRRT versus\n11% with everolimus ( p= 0.02). This result is less contrasted for grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity\nfound in 1% of PRRT and 2.5% of everolimus treatments ( p= 0.34).']"
1E advanced RAG,What is the role of PRRT in GEP-NET?,english,general,therapy,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is utilized in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) that are well-differentiated and express somatostatin receptors. PRRT, particularly with agents like 177Lu-DOTATATE, has been validated for its effectiveness in controlling tumor progression and is recognized for its relatively low toxicity (Camus et al., 2021). This therapy is indicated for patients with inoperable or metastatic GEP-NETs who have failed first-line treatments such as somatostatin analogues or targeted therapies. PRRT works by targeting somatostatin receptors that are overexpressed in these tumors, delivering radionuclides directly to the tumor cells, which allows for internal radiation therapy. The treatment has shown to improve progression-free survival and quality of life in patients, and it is considered a viable option for those with high receptor expression confirmed by diagnostic imaging (Hirmas et al., 2018; Rogoza et al., 2022).",,,,"['Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']"

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease. Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']"
2E advanced RAG,For which indication is PRRT approved?,english,specific,therapy,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"PRRT, specifically with ^177Lu-DOTATATE, is approved for the treatment of adult patients with somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) (Fani et al., 2022). Additionally, it has received prescription authorization in France for metastatic midgut NETs (Camus et al., 2021).",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', '2.2. Clinical Studies and Approvals\nToday, PRRT with radiolabeled SST agonists (e.g., DOTA-TOC or DOTA-TATE, Table 1)\nis part of the standard of care of NENs. NETTER-1 (NCT01578239; EudraCT number\n2011-005049-11 ) was the ﬁrst prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial to com-\npare four cycles of177Lu-DOTA-TATE (4 ×7.4 GBq) plus 30 mg long-acting release oc-\ntreotide (PRRT group, n = 117) with high-dose (60 mg double dose) long-acting release\noctreotide (control group, n = 114) in advanced, progressive midgut NET patients. There\nwas a signiﬁcantly longer progression-free survival for the PRRT arm ( p< 0.001) [ 22]\nand a signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life [ 23]. Consequently,177Lu-DOTA-TATE\n(177Lu-oxodotreotide ) received marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients\nwith SST-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). At the ﬁnal\nanalysis of overall survival (OS), the median OS was improved by 11.7 months for the\n177Lu-DOTA-TATE arm versus the control arm (48.0 (95% CI, 37.4–55.2) vs. 36.3 (95% CI,\n25.9–51.7) months, respectively), which, however, did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in the\nlong-term follow-up with a median of 6.3 years [ 24]. Regarding safety, the NETTER-1 data\nshow a low incidence of long-term side-effects regarding hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\nCurrently , a second prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase\nIII trial, COMPETE (NCT03049189), is ongoing, in which PRRT using177Lu-DOTA-TOC\n(177Lu-edotreotide, four cycles with 7.5 GBq/cycle) is being compared with the mTOR\ninhibitor everolimus (10 mg daily) in patients with progressive, SST-positive GEP-NETs.\nUpon completion of the study, the approval of177Lu-DOTA-TOC is expected. These\ntrials and other trials (e.g., OCCLURANDOM, NCT02230176) should further precisely\ndetermine the position of PRRT in the current clinical algorithm with regard to other\nsystemic therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib.\nUsing routes other than intravenous administration may be an interesting approach to\nenhance the therapeutic and safety window of PRRT. NENs and their liver metastases are\noften highly perfused, and the intra-arterial route can exploit the ﬁrst-pass effect to treat\nliver-dominant disease more efﬁciently. Such an approach can also be used for inoperable\nprimary tumors to downstage the disease in the neoadjuvant setting [ 25,26]. However,\nlarge comparative prospective trials supporting its wider use are missing.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 4 of 15\n4. Indications of PRRT in NETs\n4.1. Gastrointestinal NET\nStudies on the role of PRRT in Grade 1–2 gastrointestinal NETs were evaluated with\ntwo different plotters:90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. The use of90Y-DOTATOC\nat a dose of 3.7 GBq/m2in 1109 patients with gastrointestinal NET ( n= 387), pancreatic\n(n= 342), pulmonary ( n= 84) or other ( n= 296) showed a morphologic response rate by\n34% measured by a decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all pretherapeutically\ndetected tumor lesions. to the response assessment criteria usual radiological RECIST.\nIn patients with intestinal and pancreatic NET, the levels of objective responses were\n47% and 27%, respectively. In the overall population, the median of overall survival was\n95 months [ 7]. The comparison clinical trials and retrospective series on the PRRT with\nthe use of90Y-DOTATOC in the gastroenteropancreatic NETs is impossible because the\npatient selection procedures, the criteria for ﬁxation of the tracer to pre-therapeutic imaging,\nand infusion protocols differ widely in function of the studies. Currently, based on the\nNETTER-1 study, the177LuDOTATATE- is the most widely used radiopeptide.\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the more widely used radiopeptide. This radiolabel has\ndemonstrated an efﬁciency similar to90Y-DOTATOC, but with lower toxicity, especially\nhematologic (Table 1, [ 2,8–14]). In a serie of 310 patients treated for Gastroenteropancreatic\nNET per four cycles of 7.4 GBq of177Lu-DOTATATE, it was found an objective response\nrate of 30%. Poor general condition (Karnofsky score < 70%) and liver damage were\nassociated with an incorrect response to the treatment. For example,177Lu-DOTATATE and\n90Y-DOTATOC treatments are associated with poor results when tumor volume is high [ 15].\nIn a meta-analysis of 473 patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE for a NET, objective\nresponse rates ranged from 18% to 44% depending on the RECIST criteria, with an average\ndisease control rate of 81% [ 16]. Retrospective and Phase II studies of177Lu-DOTATATE\nshowed a median progression-free survival of 33–36 months in patients with metastatic\nsmall size NET with documented tumor progression and/or an uncontrolled carcinoid\nsymptom [8].\nIn this context, the NETTER-1 (Phase III randomized study) has evaluated and po-\nsitioned the place of the PRRT at a very early stage in the management of patients with\nmetastatical midgut NET [ 2]. This study compared 229 patients with advanced metastatic\nmidgut NET, an Octreoscanner binding and progression under SSA at a ﬁxed dose of 30 mg\nper month Octreotide,177Lu-DOTATATE versus 60 mg per month of Octreotide (double\ndose). The study’s outcome was progression-free survival evaluated according to the radio-\nlogical criteria RECIST 1.1. The treatment with177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in a reduction of\n79% of the risk of progression or death, compared to double-dose Octreotide (p< 0.0001) .\nThe median survival progression was not reached in the group treated with PRRT versus\n8.4 months in the control group. Moreover, treatment with PRRT was associated with\na rate of objective response of 18% versus 3% with Octreotide ( p< 0.0004). Thus, and\nbased on this Phase III data,177Lu-DOTATATE is positioned as a new therapeutic option\nin grade 1–2 midgut NETs after disease progression under SSA and has been obtained\nmarketing authorization for this indication. It is important to note that long-term follow-up\nis necessary in order to assess the impact of this new treatment on the overall patient\nsurvival.']"

In a retrospective\nstudy, Kashyap et al. [ 37] showed favorable outcomes in pa-\ntients with\n18F-FDG PET-positive GEP-NETs with advanced\nprogressive68Ga-octreotate PET-avid disease with a combi-\nnation of 5-FU and177Lu-octreotate. Among 52 patients, they\nreport CR in 2%, PR 28%, SD 68%, and PD in only 2% of\npatients with median PFS 48 months.\nA recent randomized clinical trial by Ballal et al. [ 38]\nestablished clinical efficacy of177Lu-DOTATATE combina-\ntion with capecitabine over PRRT alone. According to\nRECIST 1.1 criteria, in the combination group, PR was\nachieved in 34%, SD in 50.2%, and PD in 6.8% of patients(compared to 6.3, 60.9, and 26.5% in the PRRT-only group,\nrespectively), and the combination group was shown to have\nlonger OS and PFS. No significant differences in hematolog-ical toxicity or hepatotoxicity were reported between both\ngroups.\nNeoadjuvant PRRT\nThe use of PRRT in patients with inoperable pNETs as neo-\nadjuvant therapy, targeting tumor shrinkage, and making it\nmore amenable to surgery is very promising. There are some\ncase reports describing the use of neoadjuvant PRRT, partic-ularly 90Y-DOTATATE in patients with pancreatic NETs who\ncould be operated on successfully after PRRT [ 39–42].\nEzzidin et al. [ 43] reported a patient with pNET and liver\nmetastases who received neoadjuvant therapy with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. There was a partial response with tumor shrinkage\nand a small residual metastatic liver lesion. The primary tumorwas then completely resected and the patient remained in CR\nlocally for 22 months postoperatively. Barber et al. [ 44]r e -\nported treating five patients with inoperable NETs with the\ncombination of\n177Lu-octreotate and 5-FU. One of them\nunderwent subsequent complete surgical resection andremained 12 months postoperatively alive and free of disease.\nVan Vliet and colleagues [ 45] studied 29 patients with a\npathology-proven nonfunctioning pNETs treated with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. After treatment, successful surgery was performedin nine patients (31%). The median PFS was 69 months for\npatients with successful surgery and 49 months for the other\npatients. Hence, neoadjuvant treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate\nis a valuable option for patients with initially unresectablepNETs.\nKwekkeboom et al. [ 46] retrospectively studied 310 patients\nwith pNETs who received treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate.\nFour patients with partially res ponding nonfunctioning pNETs\nwere able to undergo complete surgical resection.

The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).']"

What is the role of PRRT in specific\nsettings of NF-Pan- NET\nPRRT is an effective and relatively safe therapeutic option for patients\nwith NF-Pan-NET. The two-arm randomised phase II noncomparative\nOCLURANDOM trial of PRRT and sunitinib in SST-PET/CT-positiveadvanced Pan-NET patients met its primary endpoint by achieving asignificant PFS with PRRT (177Lu-DOTATATE) (median 20.7 months\nof PRRT and 11.0 months of sunitinib, respectively).\n50\nA recent retrospective study, NETTER-R, also suggested a poten-\ntial benefit of 177Lu-DOTATATE as a treatment option in Pan-NET.51\nCurrent clinical trials are focusing on the prospective evaluation\nof PRRT in Pan-NET (including G3) and in the first-line\n(NCT03972488, NCT04919226).\nIn 2020, a combined analysis of two prospective and six retro-\nspective studies using PRRT in Pan-NET was published, showing a\nmedian PFS ranging from 20 to 39 months and median OS from 37 to\n79 months (PFS and OS were comparable for gastroenteropancreatic(GEP)-NET from different locations).\n52\nThere are still limited data on the efficacy of PRRT for Pan-NET\nG3. In 2019, Zhang et al. reported the results of PRRT with177Lu/\n90Y- (DOTATATE or DOTATOC) in 69 patients, including\n46 patients with Pan-NET.', 'receiving the same combination. Authors report a CR of 13%\nand PR of 70%, with no patients manifesting a PD, and the\nmedian PFS was 48 months. Both of these studies were un-controlled and nonrandomized clinical trials. In a retrospective\nstudy, Kashyap et al. [ 37] showed favorable outcomes in pa-\ntients with\n18F-FDG PET-positive GEP-NETs with advanced\nprogressive68Ga-octreotate PET-avid disease with a combi-\nnation of 5-FU and177Lu-octreotate. Among 52 patients, they\nreport CR in 2%, PR 28%, SD 68%, and PD in only 2% of\npatients with median PFS 48 months.\nA recent randomized clinical trial by Ballal et al. [ 38]\nestablished clinical efficacy of177Lu-DOTATATE combina-\ntion with capecitabine over PRRT alone. According to\nRECIST 1.1 criteria, in the combination group, PR was\nachieved in 34%, SD in 50.2%, and PD in 6.8% of patients(compared to 6.3, 60.9, and 26.5% in the PRRT-only group,\nrespectively), and the combination group was shown to have\nlonger OS and PFS. No significant differences in hematolog-ical toxicity or hepatotoxicity were reported between both\ngroups.\nNeoadjuvant PRRT\nThe use of PRRT in patients with inoperable pNETs as neo-\nadjuvant therapy, targeting tumor shrinkage, and making it\nmore amenable to surgery is very promising. There are some\ncase reports describing the use of neoadjuvant PRRT, partic-ularly 90Y-DOTATATE in patients with pancreatic NETs who\ncould be operated on successfully after PRRT [ 39–42].\nEzzidin et al. [ 43] reported a patient with pNET and liver\nmetastases who received neoadjuvant therapy with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. There was a partial response with tumor shrinkage\nand a small residual metastatic liver lesion. The primary tumorwas then completely resected and the patient remained in CR\nlocally for 22 months postoperatively. Barber et al. [ 44]r e -\nported treating five patients with inoperable NETs with the\ncombination of\n177Lu-octreotate and 5-FU. One of them\nunderwent subsequent complete surgical resection andremained 12 months postoperatively alive and free of disease.\nVan Vliet and colleagues [ 45] studied 29 patients with a\npathology-proven nonfunctioning pNETs treated with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. After treatment, successful surgery was performedin nine patients (31%). The median PFS was 69 months for\npatients with successful surgery and 49 months for the other\npatients. Hence, neoadjuvant treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate\nis a valuable option for patients with initially unresectablepNETs.\nKwekkeboom et al. [ 46] retrospectively studied 310 patients\nwith pNETs who received treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate.\nFour patients with partially res ponding nonfunctioning pNETs\nwere able to undergo complete surgical resection. One of them\ndied postoperatively from surgi cal complications. Recently, a\nstudy abstract from the European Pancreatic Club (EPC) 2017meeting [ 47] compared patients with initially metastatic and/or\nlocally advanced pNETs who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT\nwith a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery.After PRRT, tumor size decreased from 59 to 50 mm, and the\nrate of curative resection was 65%. The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

4E advanced RAG,What is Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)?,english,general,definition,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is a molecular therapy used in the treatment of specific types of cancers, particularly neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This therapy involves the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogues, which are compounds that mimic the action of the natural hormone somatostatin. PRRT targets somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) that are overexpressed on the surface of certain tumor cells. The radiolabeled analogues bind to these receptors and are internalized into the tumor cell, where they emit radiation that kills the cell. The therapy is noted for its ability to deliver targeted radiation to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues, thus reducing side effects (Hirmas et al., 2018).",,,,"['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach.

For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Symptomatic relief was encountered in this therapy in patients\nwith metastasized GEP-NETs.

In a recent study on bron-\nchial and GEP-NETs, Brabander et al. [ 27] evaluated safety,\nefficacy and toxicity of177Lu-DOTATATE and showed im-\npressive results. The objective response rate (ORR) reached\n39%, stable disease (SD) was reported in 43% of patients, andthe PFS and OS for all NET patients were 29 and 63 months,\nrespectively (Fig. 3).\nWith time, the use of PRRT which initially targeted\nNETs was extended to other types of confirmed SSTR-positive tumors. Tumors such as breast cancer, lymphoma,\nglioma, meningioma, and paraganglioma, as well as non-\niodine-absorbing differentiated thyroid cancer can now be\nconsidered for PRRT when registered therapies have failed[8].\n177Lu Radionuclide and NETTER-1 Trial\nThe Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial is thefirst randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy\nFig. 1 aMIP image of68Ga\nDOTATOC PET shows the\nprimary NET in the small bowel\non the right side of the abdomen\n(red arrow) with extensive livermetastases, both demonstratingintense increased radiotracer\nuptake reflecting the high\nexpression of the somatostatinreceptors.

Several retrospective studies focusing on feasibility, outcome, and safety of\nPRRT also showed a PFS of the commonly “hot” somatostatin analog comparable and, in some cases,\nsuperior to other treatment modalities (Table 3). Given the fact that these studies were of retrospective\ndesign, the results had to be followed up in prospective trials.\nTable 3.

The OS for the PRRT arm has not yet been reached [ 93]. By contrast, the current published\nEuropean Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) guidelines recommend the use of PRRT in\nintestinal (midgut) NETs with distance and /or locoregional metastases as a second- to third-line therapy\nafter progression under SSA, irrespective of the abovementioned NETTER-1 results. According to\nguidelines in pancreatic NET with advanced locoregional disease, PRRT should even be used as a third\nline therapy after failure of SSA, everolimus and /or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 42]. On this basis, a new\nphase III study was recently initiated. In the COMPETE study (see clinicaltrials.gov NCT03049189),\n177Lu-PRRT is compared with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in patients with GEP-NET G1 and\n2. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients beneﬁt from PRRT, and patients’\nrelapse after starting treatment is, on average, seen after 2–3 years [ 94]. In 2018, a retrospective study\nof 168 patients with unresectable GEP-NETs treated at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany was\npublished. The patients were divided into two groups: PRRT monotherapy ( n=81, group 1) and PRRT\nplus SSA ( n=87, group 2). The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96].

Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved.

For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54].

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']"

With the perspective of several years of clinical use,\nPRRT with90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs appears to be well-tolerated with favorable long-term\noutcome.', '19 I.9 Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy  Including surgery and external radiation therapy, there is often no curative treatment available for a large group of patients with disseminated carcinomas. Radionuclide therapy represents an interesting (complementary) option to current treatment modalities because it permits the delivery of a high dose of therapeutic radiation to cancer cells while minimizing exposure of normal cells (143). Due to the fundamental linkage of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to cancer progression and metastasis, the CXCR4 receptor holds great potential for targeted radionuclide therapy. The specific activity of the peptide should be as high as possible to reach the maximal achievable absorbed dose in the tumor. Since radionuclide-conjugated peptides are administered in low mass amounts, unwanted side effects like the mobilization of stem cells in the case of CXCR4-targeting peptides are very unlikely to occur whereas ionizing irradiation is effectively delivered to the target. Before treatment, peptides can be radiolabeled with diagnostic radionuclides to identify receptor-positive tumor lesions, for treatment planning, and also dosimetry. Exchange to a therapeutic radionuclide, often by using the same peptide-conjugate, enables targeted radionuclide therapy. DOTATATE for instance has been labeled with different radionuclides for diagnosis (mainly 111In and 68Ga) and also treatment (mainly 177Lu and 90Y) of neuroendocrine tumors (144-146).  The decay properties of radionuclides, e.g. β- or α emission, emission energy, linear energy transfer (LET), and half-life are important characteristics for diagnosis and therapy and can be chosen individually, depending on the type of the tumor, its size, intratumoral distribution (i.e. degree of heterogeneity of radionuclide deposition), pharmacokinetics, and other factors. 177Lu for instance (β-, Emax 0.5 MeV, tissue rangemax 2 mm (144,147) is more appropriate for smaller tumors, while 90Y (β-, Emax 2.3 MeV, tissue rangemax 12 mm (144,147), may be beneficial for larger lesions with heterogeneous receptor expression (144,147,148). Compared to β-particles (LET: 0.1-1 keV/µm) and γ irradiation, the local density of ionizations along a track of α-particles is considerably higher because multiple ionizations  (60-230 keV/µm) occur in the immediate vicinity of the decay site (149). Hence, α-particle emitters can be beneficial to target single cancer cells, i.e. micro-metastases, which are difficult to treat by currently employed techniques (150). Moreover, the high specific ionization of α-emitters causes a higher fraction of double strand breaks and can break radio- and chemoresistance (151). Furthermore, cell death due to α-irradiation is minimally dependent on tumor oxygenation, which means that cells are killed effectively even in hypoxic areas of the tumor (152,153). Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of α-emitters like 211At, 213Bi, and 225Ac have been investigated in some early stage clinical trials (149,150,154). An overview of selected radionuclides for therapy is given in Table 3.']"

Radiopharmaceuticals used in therapy are\ndesigned in the same way as those used in imaging, only the nature of the radioelement being modiﬁed.\nContrary to imaging, which uses radioelements having very penetrating but little ionizing radiations,\nPRRT privileges the use of radionuclides that have little penetrating and more energetic and thus more\nionizing radiations. Brought directly to the cancer cell, the radiation emitted by the radioactive decay\ncauses irreversible ionization of the cell’s DNA, which induces its apoptosis. The main isotopes used\ntoday are iodine-131, yttrium-90, lutetium-177 and, to a lesser extent, rhenium-188 [ 158]. As mentioned\nearlier, the purpose of the DOTA-SSA design was to work with a chelating cavity capable of complexing\nradioelements for imaging or therapy. Consequently, most of the platforms discussed above have been\ntransposed for therapeutic application via the use of β−emitters [64,74,81,82].\n3.2.1.

Akute Nebenwirkungen wie Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Müdigkeit und Bauchschmerzen sind hauptsächlich auf die gleichzeitige Infusion von Aminosäuren zurückzuführen. Langfristige Nebenwirkungen können Nierenversagen und leukämische oder myelodysplastische Syndrome umfassen. Trotz dieser potenziellen Nebenwirkungen ist das Risiko für schwerwiegende Schäden wie Endstadium-Nierenkrankheiten oder schwere hämatologische Toxizitäten relativ gering, und viele der Nebenwirkungen sind reversibel oder können durch präventive Maßnahmen gemindert werden (Zaknun et al., 2013; Camus et al., 2021).",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'during the first courses of therapy following the injection of\n177Lu-DOTATATE.\nSide effects\nAcute\nSide effects of PRRNT are usually mild, if necessary precau-\ntions are taken. Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing. In such cases,\n177Lu-labelled pepti-\nd e ss h o u l db eu s e da n dt h ea d m i n i s t e r e da c t i v i t ys h o u l db e\nreduced accordingly. After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 8 of 17\n8.1. Hematological Toxicity\nPRRT can induce hematological toxicity through bone marrow radiation. The vast\nmajority of patients only have mild and reversible hematological toxicity with a nadir at\n4–6 weeks after administration of PRRT [ 27,36,50]. However, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,\nthrombocytopenia or leukopenia have been observed in, respectively, 1%, 2% and 1% of\nthe patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE in the NETTER-1 trial [ 27]. PRRT-induced\nsevere lymphopenia is the most common hematological toxicity [ 27,29], but it has not been\nassociated with increased susceptibility for infections [90]. Thrombocytopenia is the most\ncommon cause of dose reduction in PRRT, whereas bleeding complications are rare [ 27].\nCaution should be taken in patients with widespread bone metastases (Figure 2A), due\nto the risk of persistent cytopenia. In the absence of alternative treatment options, PRRT\nshould preferably be initiated at half the regular activity (3.7 GBq)177Lu-DOTATATE in\nthese patients. Additionally, there is a relevant long-term risk of 2% for the development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 1% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after\nPRRT [ 27,29,91]. Little is known about the pathophysiology of persistent hematological\ntoxicity, but a role for clonal hematopoiesis has been postulated [ 92]. Known risk factors\nfor severe hematological toxicity include decreased renal function, pre-existent cytopenias,\nextensive tumor mass, age over 70, extensive bone metastases and pre-treatment with\nmyelotoxic chemotherapy [ 91,93,94]. Additionally, women are at higher risk for developing\nsubacute grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia than men, which was independent from other risk\nfactors in a multivariable analysis [89].\n8.2. Nephrotoxicity\nDue to SSTR expression in the kidneys and the renal excretion of radiolabeled SSAs, the\nkidneys receive a high radiation dose during PRRT. Following glomerular filtration, SSAs are re-\nabsorbed in the proximal tubuli of the renal cortex because of active transport mechanisms [ 95].\nBy saturating this re-uptake mechanism through the use of lysine and arginine, re-absorption of\nradiolabeled peptides can be significantly reduced. This results in less radiation-induced nephro-\ntoxicity by a reduction of the absorbed kidney dose up to 40% [ 96,97]. However, nephrotoxicity\nafter PRRT still occurs such as tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy and thrombotic microan-\ngiopathy [ 98]. In the NETTER-1 study , grade ≥3 renal toxicity was observed in 5% of the\n177Lu-DOTATATE group and in 4% of the control group [ 30]. Bergsma et al. reported an overall\ncreatinine clearance loss of 3.4% 1 year after PRRT. No subacute grade ≥3 renal toxicity was\nseen and 1.5% of the patients showed grade 3 renal toxicity in the long term. However, all these\npatients had a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min at baseline [ 99]. A reduced kidney function\ncan lead to a delayed renal excretion of177Lu-DOTATATE and this has also been associated with\na higher risk of hematological toxicity [ 95]. Risk factors associated with renal toxicity include\nage > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal disease, cumulative radiation\ndose to the kidneys, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy , tumor or metastases close to the\nkidney and previous PRRT with90Y-DOTATOC [ 100]. Post-renal obstruction can be observed in\nsome GEP-NET patients, particularly in those with retroperitoneal or pelvic metastases, but this\ncan also be caused by the primary tumor, nephrolithiasis and abdominal or retroperitoneal fi-\nbrosis [ 101].']"

Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57].

Allerdings ist die PRRT nicht ohne Risiken, und es gibt Bedenken hinsichtlich langfristiger Nebenwirkungen wie Knochenmark- und Nierentoxizität (Harris & Zhernosekov, 2022). Die Behandlung wird derzeit als Teil eines umfassenderen Behandlungsregimes angesehen, insbesondere nach dem Versagen anderer Therapien wie Somatostatin-Analoga und Everolimus. Die zukünftige Positionierung der PRRT in der Behandlungsreihenfolge und die Optimierung der Behandlungsprotokolle sind Gegenstand laufender Forschung und klinischer Studien.

Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs.

In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31].

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27].

PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3].

Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

All that\nshould be expected is that the practitioner will follow a reason-\nable course of action based on current knowledge, available re-\nsources, and the needs of the patient to deliver effective and safe\nmedical care. The sole purpose of these procedure standards is to\nassist practitioners in ac hieving this objective.\nBACKGROUND\nNETs are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that frequently\noverexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) ( 1). NETs can be im-\naged using somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labeled with68Ga (68Ga-\nDOTATATE and68Ga-DOTATOC) ( 2).b-emitting radionuclides\nsuch as177Lu can be used for PRRT ( 3). The NETTER-1 trial\ndemonstrated prolonged progression-free survival in midgut NET\npatients treated with 4 cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE, which subse-\nquently led to the approval of this therapy ( 4).\nTREATMENT OVERVIEW\n177Lu-DOTATATE is administered at an activity of 7.4 GBq\n(200 mCi) every 8 61 wk for 4 cycles. Combined with prophy-\nlactic amino acid infusions and antiemetics, each treatment visit\ncan last approximately 5–8 h ( Fig. 1). Before starting PRRT treat-\nments, each treatment site must ensure that177Lu is included in their\ninstitutional radioactive materials license. A detailed review of pro-\ncedures surrounding177Lu-DOTATATE therapy is provided below.\nPATIENT SCREENING\nPatients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary NET team,\nincluding a cancer specialist with expertise in the medical man-\nagement of NETs as well as a nuclear medicine physician or\nappropriate authorized user to decide on the appropriateness and\ntiming of PRRT in individual patients. Potential candidates should\nundergo an SSTR PET scan or SSTR scintigraphy (111In-pentetreotide)\nto demonstrate adequate SSTR expression ( 2). Traditionally, SSTR\nexpression on111In-pentetreotide greater than background hepatic\nuptake has been considered an eligibility requirement for PRRT\n(5). Necessary levels of SSTR expression on68Ga-based SSTR\nPET have not been clearly deﬁned, but lesion uptake should ex-\nceed background hepatic uptake. Laboratory values should be\nchecked shortly before the treatment is ordered (typically 2 wk\nbefore each cycle). These should include blood urea nitrogen,\ncreatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, white blood cell\nwith differential, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. The threshold\nvalues provided in Table 1 should be taken as general eligibility\nguidelines for therapy.SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG THERAPY\nSSA therapy is used frequently to treat NET patients, and SSAs\nare typically administered in depot formulations every 4 wk. It is\nrecommended that PRRT treatments be scheduled at least 4 wk\nafter the last long-acting SSA therapy to prevent interference with\nSSTR binding. For symptomatic patients, short-acting SSAs being\nused as a bridge should be stopped at least 24 h before treatment.\nSubsequent SSA doses can be administered as soon as several hours\nafter the completion of the radiopharmaceutical therapy. During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy. It is unclear whether patients\nwith nonfunctional tumors should remain on SSA treatment regard-\nless of whether or not they had progressed on SSA therapy before\ninitiation of PRRT. In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.']"

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'during the first courses of therapy following the injection of\n177Lu-DOTATATE.\nSide effects\nAcute\nSide effects of PRRNT are usually mild, if necessary precau-\ntions are taken. Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing. In such cases,\n177Lu-labelled pepti-\nd e ss h o u l db eu s e da n dt h ea d m i n i s t e r e da c t i v i t ys h o u l db e\nreduced accordingly. After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27].

Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89].

The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.']"

In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 4 of 17\n3.2. Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 4 of 17\n3.2. Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved. Figure 1\ndemonstrates a representative case of PRRT in a neoadjuvant setting.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']"
14E advanced RAG,What are the challenges of PRRT?,english,general,challenges of therapy,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) faces several challenges, including the management of side effects and the optimization of treatment efficacy. Key challenges include:

1. **Toxicity Management**: PRRT is associated with various side effects ranging from mild to severe. Acute side effects such as nausea and vomiting are common, while subacute effects like bone marrow suppression can occur 4 to 6 weeks post-therapy (Hirmas et al., 2018). Long-term risks include renal failure and hematological complications such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (Camus et al., 2021).

2. **Treatment Efficacy**: While PRRT shows promising results, complete responses are rare, and tumor progression eventually occurs in the majority of patients. This necessitates additional cycles or salvage therapy, which may have diminished efficacy compared to initial treatments (Hirmas et al., 2018).

3. **Patient Selection and Treatment Timing**: Identifying the right candidates for PRRT and determining the optimal timing for its administration are crucial. The therapy is often considered after the failure of other treatments like SSAs or everolimus, and its effectiveness can be influenced by factors such as the extent of disease and prior treatments (Rogoza et al., 2022).

4. **Experimental Approaches**: New strategies and experimental approaches are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of PRRT and reduce side effects. This includes intra-arterial administration for hepatic metastases and adjusting the treatment regimen based on individual tolerance (Rogoza et al., 2022).

These challenges highlight the need for ongoing research and tailored treatment strategies to optimize the therapeutic outcomes of PRRT while minimizing its risks.",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.', 'Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.']"

The naked, unstable radionuclide incor-\nporates into the extracellular environment, and the α particle \nemission in the tumor microenvironment suppresses abnormal \nbone formation and induces cell death (20). The phase 3 AL-\nSYMPCA (or, ΑLpharadin in SYMPtomatic Prostate CAncer) \ntrial demonstrated that 223RaCl2 was well tolerated and im-\nproved median overall survival to 14.9 months in the treat-\nment arm versus 11.3 months in the placebo arm (30% risk \nreduction; hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.83]; P < .001); \nit also improved the median time to first symptomatic skeletal \nevent to 15.6 months in the radium arm versus 9.8 months in \nthe placebo arm (34% risk reduction; hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% \nCI: 0.52, 0.83]; P < .001) (19).\nSomatostatin Receptor–targeted Radionuclide Therapy\nSomatostatin receptors (SSR), particularly SSR2a, expressing \nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas and midgut \ncan be imaged with gallium 68 (68Ga) DOTA peptides (DOT -\nATATE [tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid octreotate], \nDOTANOC [tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid sodium \ntriiodide octreotide], and DOTATOC [tetraazacyclododecane \ntetraacetic acid D-phenylalanine 1 tyrosine 3 octreotide]), in-\ndium 111 (111In) octreotide, or 99 mTc-octreotide and treated \nwith 177Lu-DOTA-peptides or yttrium 99 octreotate (21) as a \ntheranostic pair.

This treatment is not pre-ferred in pregnant patients.

However, \nsince Y-90 does not emit gamma rays, gamma imag-\ning, and subsequent dosimetry calculations cannot be made. For this reason, indium-111 (In-111) is used with the Y-90 as it allows pre-treatment imaging for dosimetry evaluation and patient-specific dosing.

Prospective data suggest that SABR is well tolerated\nand improves PFS in patients with oligometastatic PCa [ 50]. In the randomized STOMP study, which\nused choline PET /CT, stereotactic ablation of oligometastatic disease in 62 patients delayed the need\nfor hormonal therapy from 13 to 21 months compared with surveillance [ 51]. Data from ORIOLE, a\nsimilar randomized Phase II study investigating the e ﬃcacy of SABR in forestalling metastases for\nhormone-sensitive PCa compared with observation, provide evidence for the value of PSMA PET /CT\nin controlling disease [ 52]. Patients randomized to the SABR arm of ORIOLE underwent18F-DCFPyl\nPET/CT, a urea-based PSMA radiotracer, prior to and 180 days after treatment. Patients with no\nadditional untreated lesions detected by PSMA PET /CT at baseline were signiﬁcantly less likely to\ndevelop new metastatic lesions at six months than those whose PSMA PET /CT showed at least one\nadditional lesion at baseline (16% vs. 63%, respectively).\nCurrently, the only PSMA-targeted imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration is111In-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint), which is approved for SPECT imaging of\nbiopsy-proven PCa localized to the prostatic bed but at high risk for pelvic LNM. Regulatory approval\nof PSMA radiotracers in the United States has lagged behind other areas of the world, such as Europe\nand Australia, where much of the innovation in PSMA theranostics has occurred. Given the growing\nevidence of the clinical potential of PSMA, its availability is expanding in the United States, and\nregulatory approval of novel radiotracers, including68Ga-PSMA-11 and18F-DCFPyl, is expected within\nthe next year. Ongoing clinical trials will help to better deﬁne the clinical role and impact of PSMA\nimaging and possibly strengthen the case for regulatory approval (Table 1).

PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT)\nPSMA has also emerged as a promising therapeutic molecular target. Although various therapies are\nnow approved for mCRPC, their survival benefit is generally limited to less than 6 months. There is thus a\nclinical need for novel therapies leading to a sustained response. Progress in the development of synthetic\nPSMA radioligands has led to an emerging body of research indicating significant therapeutic efficacy of\nPSMA RLT.\nPSMA RLT studies have mostly utilized small-molecule inhibitors of PSMA as radioligands, which\nhave been shown to be less hematotoxic than monoclonal antibodies. For instance, a study of MEDI3726\n(a PSMA-targeted antibody–drug conjugate) in patients with mCRPC after failure of abiraterone or\nenzalumatide observed significant responses at higher doses of MEDI3726, although responses were not\ndurable because patients discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events [ 53].

This review is intended to deliver a comprehensive overview\nof current and past investigations of low-molecular-weight PSMA\nradioligands for PC imaging and t herapy. Providing insights into\npast and promising current developments regarding PSMA anti-\nbody imaging, especially targeting J591, is beyond the scope of this\nreview.\nPSMA AS TARGET FOR PC IMAGING AND THERAPY\nPSMA is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. PSMA expres-\nsion and localization in the normal human prostate are associated\nwith the cytoplasm and apical side of the epithelium surrounding\nthe prostatic ducts ( 28). PSMA is enzymatically active only in its\ndimeric form, but its function for prostate cells is still unknown\n(29). Dysplastic and neoplastic transformation of prostate tissue\nresults in the transfer of PSMA from the apical membrane to the\nluminal surface of the ducts ( 30,31 ). For several reasons, PSMA is\nan ideal target in PC.\nFirst, it is signiﬁcantly overexpressed (100–1,000 fold) on nearly\nall PC cells ( 32–35), although 5%–10% of primary PC or PC lesions\nhad negative PSMA results on PET ( 36,37 ). However, the underly-\ning etiology of PC with negative PSMA results on PET is still\nunclear, given the lack of prospective studies and correlation with\nimmunohistochemistry.\nSecond, its expression is further increased in advanced stages\nand in mCRPC ( 32,34,38 ).\nThird, after binding to the active center of the extracellular do-\nmain, PSMA ligands are internalized. Subsequent endosomal\nrecycling increases the deposition, leading to enhanced tumor uptake,\nretention, and subsequent high i mage quality for diagnostic proce-\ndures and a high local dose for therapeutic applications ( 29,39,40 ).\nPreclinical data showed that PSMA expression is independent\nof the use of taxane-based chemotherapy. This property may allow\ndirect PC imaging—an advantage over bone scintigraphy and CT\nimaging—without the “ﬂare phenomenon” ( 41). However, gene\ntranscription analysis demonstrated that androgen can suppress\nthe promoter of the PSMA gene ( 42,43 ). Therefore, the initiation\nof androgen deprivation therapy induces early but temporary upre-\ngulation of PSMA expression, downregulation under prolonged\nandrogen deprivation therapy and, ﬁnally, overexpression of PSMA\nin androgen-resistant tumors ( 44–47). A preliminary work outlined\nthis effect, which could be leveraged for improved diagnosis and\ntherapy ( 48).\nInterestingly, PSMA expression in the tumor neovasculature of\nsome solid tumors (colon, breast, kidney, and subtypes of bladdercancer) poses potential pitfalls in imaging ( 32,49 –54) but also\noffers potential opportunities for theranostic applications in can-\ncers other than PC.\nCOMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF\nPSMA LIGANDS IN CLINICAL USE\nTo date, no PSMA small molecule has been approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency.']"

Additionally, the CLARINET study investigated the antiproliferative effects of lanreotide in patients with advanced G1/G2 differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive NETs, showing significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to placebo (del Olmo-Garcia et al., 2021).",,,,"['Oncotarget16933\nwww.oncotarget.com\nINTRODUCTION\nNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) arise most \nfrequently in the gastroentero-pancreatic system and lungs. \nThese neoplasms originate in scattered endocrine cells of \nthe diffuse neuroendocrine system and are biologically \nvery heterogeneous [1]. Two groups of NEN behave \nbiologically and clinically distinctively different; the well \ndifferentiated slowly growing neuroendocrine tumors with \nan excellent to good prognosis and poorly differentiated \nfast growing neuroendocrine carcinomas with a poor \nprognosis. Grading of NENs is performed by Ki67 index. \nG1 and G2 neuroendocrine tumors have a Ki67 index \nof 20% or below whereas neuroendocrine carcinomas \nhave a Ki 67 index of more than 20%. Neuroendocrine \ncarcinomas are defined by small or large cell morphology. \nIn addition, the new WHO classification of pancreatic \nNENs includes the newly created well differentiated \nneuroendocrine tumors with a proliferation of up to \n50% as neuroendocrine tumor G3 [2, 3]. NENs may be \nfunctionally active due to the autonomous secretion of \nbiogenic amines or peptide hormones such as serotonin, \ngastrin or insulin causing characteristic functional \nsyndromes [4].\nThe majority of well-differentiated NENs \noverexpress receptors of the 5 subclasses of somatostatin \nreceptors (SSTRs), most frequently receptors 2 and 5. \nActivated SSTRs have anti-secretory and anti-proliferative \nactivity, and are targeted by stable somatostatin analogues \nfor treatment of functional syndromes and to reduce tumor \ngrowth of NENs [5–7]. In addition, SSTR are utilized to \nvisualize NENs by molecular imaging. SSTR scintigraphy \nuses stable somatostatin analogues coupled to short-\nlived radionuclides such as 111Indium or 99mTechnetium. \nThe more recently developed SSTR PET/CT involves \n68Gallium (68Ga) as a positron emitter, coupled to stable \nsomatostatin analogues. This technique is more sensitive, \nfaster with much lesser radiation exposure, compared to \nthe standard SSTR scintigraphy [8]. Netspot, the first \nkit for the preparation of 68Ga-DOTATATE for PET/\nCT imaging of NENs was recently approved by the US \nFDA ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/\nucm508921.htm ).\nCoupling beta- and/or gamma-emitting \nradionuclides to stable somatostatin analogues permits \ninternal radiation of SSTR-expressing NENs by peptide \nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). 90Yttrium (90Y) and \n177Lutetium (177Lu) are used as radionuclides and chelated \nto stable somatostatin analogues such as DOTATATE \nand DOTATOC [9, 10]. Numerous phase I and phase II \nstudies have shown favorable progression-free survival \n(PFS) and overall survival (OS) in NEN patients compared \nto historical controls [9–11]. Recently, a phase III study \n(NETTER-1 trial) has compared 4 cycles of PRRT, each \nusing 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera®) together \nwith 30 mg Octreotide-LAR every 4 weeks, to high dose somatostatin analogue therapy with 2 x 30 mg Octreotide-\nLAR every 4 weeks. Patients with progressive NENs of \nsmall bowel under treatment with somatostatin analogues \nand with SSTR expression were included, and 230 were \nrandomized in a 1:1 ratio. In the control group, median \nPFS was 8.4 months, whereas it was not reached yet in the \nLutathera® group (estimation 40 months). The hazard ratio \nwas 0.209 (95% CI, 0.129-0.33) in favor of Lutathera®. \nAdverse events were rare and the treatment was well \ntolerated [12].', 'Eighty ﬁve patients with well-differentiated NETs were randomized to either receive oc-\ntreotide or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to tumor progression. Octreotide\nwas associated with a signiﬁcant longer time to tumor progression, 14.3 months, com-\npared to the placebo (6.0 months). After 6-month follow-up, signiﬁcantly lower tumor\nprogression rates were observed within the octreotide arm (37% versus 66%). Patients\nwith resected primary tumor and a lower tumor burden displayed a more favorable out-\ncome [ 42]. The CLARINET was a controlled study of lanreotide antiproliferative response\nin neuroendocrine tumors, which included advanced G1/G2 differentiated, nonfunction-\ning, somatostatin receptor–positive NETs and documented disease progression status. The\nprimary endpoint was progression-free survival. The lanreotide arm was linked to signiﬁ-\ncantly prolonged PFS compared to the placebo, with estimated rates of progression-free\nsurvival at 24 months of 65.1% in the lanreotide group and 33.0% in the placebo group [ 43].', 'Int.

Random -\nization was performed with the use of a central -\nized permuted block (block size of 4) randomiza -\ntion scheme, with stratification according to the highest tumor uptake score on somatostatin re -\nceptor scintigraphy (grade 2, 3, or 4 on a scale ranging from 0 [no uptake by tumor] to 4 [very intense uptake by tumor] with higher grades in -\ndicating a higher level of expression of soma -\ntostatin receptors)\n12 and according to the length \nof time that a patient had been receiving a con -\nstant dose of octreotide (≤6 months or >6 months).\nIn the 177Lu-Dotatate group, 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) \nof 177Lu-Dotatate was infused intravenously over \na period of 30 minutes. Patients received four infusions every 8 weeks (cumulative radioactivity, 29.6 GBq [800 mCi]) unless unacceptable toxic effects occurred, centrally confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST) was present on imaging, the patient was unable or unwilling to adhere to trial procedures, the patient with -\ndrew consent, or the patient died. For renal protection, an intravenous amino acid solution (Aminosyn II 10% [21.0 g of lysine and 20.4 g of arginine in 2 liters of solution] or VAMIN-18 [18 g of lysine and 22.6 g of arginine in 2 liters of solution]) was administered concomitantly for at least 4 hours, starting 30 minutes before infu -\nsion of the radiopharmaceutical. In the \n177Lu-\nDotatate group, patients continued to receive supportive care with octreotide LAR, which was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 30 mg approximately 24 hours after each infusion of \n177Lu-Dotatate and then monthly after completion \nof all four treatments. In the control group, octreotide LAR at a dose of 60 mg was adminis -\ntered intramuscularly every 4 weeks. In both treat -\nment groups, patients were allowed to receive subcutaneous rescue injections of octreotide in the event of hormonal symptoms (i.e., diarrhea or flushing) associated with their carcinoid syn -\ndrome.Trial Oversight\nThis trial was sponsored by Advanced Accelera -\ntor Applications and was designed by Advanced Accelerator Applications in collaboration with the last two authors. The trial protocol was approved by the investigational review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institu -\ntion. Contract research organizations monitored the trial and collected, compiled, maintained, and analyzed the data. The trial was performed in ac -\ncordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmoni -\nsation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all applicable regulations. All the patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the conduct of the trial. The first draft of the manuscript was prepared by the first author with assistance from a professional medical writer funded by the spon -\nsor.

Initial efficacy results were based on very high doses of \n111In-DTPA0-octreotide,11 but \nmore promising results were subsequently found with \n90Y-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC)17 \nand with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotate (177Lu-\nDotatate).12 Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a beta- and \ngamma-emitting radionuclide with a maximum particle range of 2 mm and a half-life of 160 hours.\n18 In a single-group trial of 177Lu-Dotatate \ninvolving 310 patients who had gastroenteropan -\ncreatic neuroendocrine tumors, complete tumor remissions occurred in 2% of the patients and partial tumor remissions in 28%.\n12 The median \nprogression-free survival was 33 months.\nWe report here results from the phase 3 Neuro -\nendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of \n177Lu-\nDotatate as compared with high-dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) in patients with advanced, progressive, somatostatin-receptor–positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis international, multicenter, phase 3 trial was conducted at 41 centers in 8 countries world -wide. Eligible patients were adults who had mid -\ngut neuroendocrine tumors that had metastasized or were locally advanced, that were inoperable, that were histologically confirmed and centrally verified, and that showed disease progression (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1\n19) on either \ncomputed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso -\nnance imaging (MRI) over the course of a maxi -\nmum period of 3 years during treatment with octreotide LAR (20 to 30 mg every 3 to 4 weeks for at least 12 weeks before randomization). Pa -\ntients were required to have a Karnofsky perfor -\nmance-status score of at least 60 (on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower numbers indicating greater disability), a tumor with well-differenti -\nated histologic features, and somatostatin recep -\ntors present on all target lesions (as confirmed by blinded, independent central review). Well-differentiated histologic features were defined as a Ki67 index (the percentage of cells that are positive for Ki67 as determined by immunos -\ntaining of the primary tumor) of 20% or less; tumors were assessed as low-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 0 to 2%, intermediate-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 3 to 20%, or high-grade if they had a Ki67 index of greater than 20%, with a lower grade indicating a lower rate of prolifera -\ntive activity.']"

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu). Its favorable safety pro/f_i  le \nand promising eﬃ   cacy have been demonstrated in a phase II study in 56 patients4. \nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT in metastasized GEP-NETs achieved a median PFS \nof 34.5 months in patients who received ≥2 treatment cycles (Figures 1 and 2). The \nCOMPETE trial is the /f_i  rst to undertake a direct comparison of PRRT vs. an approved \ntherapeutic.\nMethod\nTrial design\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase III \nclinical trial to evaluate the eﬃ   cacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT \ncompared to targeted molecular therapy with everolimus in patients with inoperable,  \nprogressive,  somatostatin  receptor-positive  (SSTR+)  GEP-NETs.

24G advanced RAG,"Ist es möglich die verschiedenen Guidelines zu Management von neuroendokrinen Tumoren vergleichend darzustellen (ENETS, NANETS)? Wo sind hier die Unterschiede in der Therapie dieser Erkrankung? ",german,specific,guidelines,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"Die ENETS (European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society) und NANETS (North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society) bieten beide Richtlinien für das Management von neuroendokrinen Tumoren (NETs), jedoch mit einigen Unterschieden in ihren Empfehlungen. Die ENETS-Richtlinien, wie in Pavel et al. (2016) dargestellt, legen einen starken Fokus auf die Verwendung von Somatostatin-Analoga (SSA), Peptidrezeptor-Radionuklidtherapie (PRRT) und zielgerichteten Therapien wie Everolimus und Sunitinib, basierend auf der Evidenz aus kontrollierten Studien. Sie betonen auch die Bedeutung einer multidisziplinären Bewertung und die Anpassung der Therapie an die individuellen Merkmale des Patienten und die Tumoreigenschaften.

Im Gegensatz dazu neigen die NANETS-Richtlinien dazu, einen breiteren Ansatz zu verfolgen, der auch die neuesten Fortschritte und Studien aus Nordamerika berücksichtigt. Sie können zusätzliche Empfehlungen für die Verwendung anderer Therapien oder für spezifische Patientenpopulationen enthalten, die in den ENETS-Richtlinien möglicherweise weniger betont werden.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass beide Richtlinien wertvolle Informationen für die Behandlung von NETs bieten, jedoch Unterschiede in den spezifischen Empfehlungen und im Umfang der berücksichtigten Daten bestehen können. Es ist wichtig, dass medizinische Fachkräfte beide Richtlinien prüfen und die Therapie auf die spezifischen Bedürfnisse und den Kontext ihrer Patienten abstimmen.",,,,"['ENETS Consensus Guidelines Update for \nDistant Metastatic Disease  Neuroendocrinology 2016;103:172–185 \nDOI: 10.1159/000443167173the rarity of the disease, the number of prospective ran-\ndomized trials is limited, and most recommendations are based on uncontrolled studies, representing expert opinions. This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  . These well-construct-\ned phase III trials in NET have an impact on the current treatment recommendations and therapeutic algorithm. In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status. Variation of treatment choices will also depend on physician exper-tise, the complexity of the treatment center and access to novel treatments. Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control. In some patients, it may be necessary to combine therapies for example to suppress symptoms using SSA in addition to locoregion-al therapies or other antiproliferative agents. \n  Locoregional Therapies \n In the absence of any large comparative trials of dif-\nferent locoregional or ablative therapies (bland embo-lization, chemoembolization, radioembolization, radio-frequency ablation or microwave destruction) or system-ic treatment, the choice of treatment is based on individual patient features (e.g. size, distribution and  Table 1.

In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  . These well-construct-\ned phase III trials in NET have an impact on the current treatment recommendations and therapeutic algorithm. In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']"

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu). Its favorable safety pro/f_i  le \nand promising eﬃ   cacy have been demonstrated in a phase II study in 56 patients4. \nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT in metastasized GEP-NETs achieved a median PFS \nof 34.5 months in patients who received ≥2 treatment cycles (Figures 1 and 2). The \nCOMPETE trial is the /f_i  rst to undertake a direct comparison of PRRT vs. an approved \ntherapeutic.\nMethod\nTrial design\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase III \nclinical trial to evaluate the eﬃ   cacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT \ncompared to targeted molecular therapy with everolimus in patients with inoperable,  \nprogressive,  somatostatin  receptor-positive  (SSTR+)  GEP-NETs.  The  study  is  \nongoing and currently recruiting patients in at least 14 countries5.Study Objectives\nPrimary Objective\nProgression-free survival (PFS). Diagnosis of progression will be established based on \nmorphological imaging (MRI and/or CT) according to RECIST 1.1.\nKey Secondary Objectives\nObjective response rates (ORR) as best outcome; overall survival (OS); duration of di-\nsease control (DDC); safety and tolerability; health-related quality of life (HRQL); dosi-\nmetry; pharmacokinetics.', 'Based on the data from the study of Baum et al. ( 19), a\nPhase-III pivotal clinical trial, COMPETE has been initiated.\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, open-label multi-\ncenter Phase III study to evaluate the safety and ef ﬁcacy of\nn.c.a.

The patients\nhave progressive, SSTR positive disease on SSTR imaging.\nUniquely, patients may be included as ﬁrst-line therapy. There\nare 3 sub-studies which focus on Lu-177-Edotreotide dosimetry\nand pharmacokinetics. These sub-studies are of great\nimportance in the development of a personalized, precision\ntherapy approach to the management of patients with PRRT.\nIn addition, Lu-177 is uniquely non-carrier-added (n.c.a.), which\nmeans that it is a pure radionuclide of high speci ﬁc activity.\nThe study has completed the recruitment of 300 patients. A\ntotal of 200 patients will receive up to 4 cycles of177Lu-edotreotide\n(7,5 GBq/cycle) every 3 months or until disease progression and\n100 patients will receive Everolimus 10 mg daily for 24 months or\nuntil disease progression.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue .

Radionuclide therapy represents an interesting (complementary) option to current treatment modalities because it permits the delivery of a high dose of therapeutic radiation to cancer cells while minimizing exposure of normal cells (143). Due to the fundamental linkage of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to cancer progression and metastasis, the CXCR4 receptor holds great potential for targeted radionuclide therapy. The specific activity of the peptide should be as high as possible to reach the maximal achievable absorbed dose in the tumor. Since radionuclide-conjugated peptides are administered in low mass amounts, unwanted side effects like the mobilization of stem cells in the case of CXCR4-targeting peptides are very unlikely to occur whereas ionizing irradiation is effectively delivered to the target. Before treatment, peptides can be radiolabeled with diagnostic radionuclides to identify receptor-positive tumor lesions, for treatment planning, and also dosimetry. Exchange to a therapeutic radionuclide, often by using the same peptide-conjugate, enables targeted radionuclide therapy. DOTATATE for instance has been labeled with different radionuclides for diagnosis (mainly 111In and 68Ga) and also treatment (mainly 177Lu and 90Y) of neuroendocrine tumors (144-146).  The decay properties of radionuclides, e.g. β- or α emission, emission energy, linear energy transfer (LET), and half-life are important characteristics for diagnosis and therapy and can be chosen individually, depending on the type of the tumor, its size, intratumoral distribution (i.e. degree of heterogeneity of radionuclide deposition), pharmacokinetics, and other factors. 177Lu for instance (β-, Emax 0.5 MeV, tissue rangemax 2 mm (144,147) is more appropriate for smaller tumors, while 90Y (β-, Emax 2.3 MeV, tissue rangemax 12 mm (144,147), may be beneficial for larger lesions with heterogeneous receptor expression (144,147,148). Compared to β-particles (LET: 0.1-1 keV/µm) and γ irradiation, the local density of ionizations along a track of α-particles is considerably higher because multiple ionizations  (60-230 keV/µm) occur in the immediate vicinity of the decay site (149). Hence, α-particle emitters can be beneficial to target single cancer cells, i.e. micro-metastases, which are difficult to treat by currently employed techniques (150). Moreover, the high specific ionization of α-emitters causes a higher fraction of double strand breaks and can break radio- and chemoresistance (151). Furthermore, cell death due to α-irradiation is minimally dependent on tumor oxygenation, which means that cells are killed effectively even in hypoxic areas of the tumor (152,153). Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of α-emitters like 211At, 213Bi, and 225Ac have been investigated in some early stage clinical trials (149,150,154). An overview of selected radionuclides for therapy is given in Table 3.']"

29G advanced RAG,Welche Isotope werden in den Studien von ITM Radiopharma verwendet?,german,general,research,gpt-4-turbo advanced RAG,"In den Studien von ITM Radiopharma werden die Isotope 131I, 123I, 124I, 90Y, 177Lu und 213Bi verwendet (Gomes Marin et al., 2020; Development of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals, 2020).",,,,"['RG • Volume 40  Number 6  Gomes Marin et al  1719\n131I. The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy. In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogs for Therapy\nConcerning radionuclide therapy and more particularly peptide receptor radionuclide therapy\n(PRRT), radioactivity is used to destroy the targeted cells. Radiopharmaceuticals used in therapy are\ndesigned in the same way as those used in imaging, only the nature of the radioelement being modiﬁed.\nContrary to imaging, which uses radioelements having very penetrating but little ionizing radiations,\nPRRT privileges the use of radionuclides that have little penetrating and more energetic and thus more\nionizing radiations. Brought directly to the cancer cell, the radiation emitted by the radioactive decay\ncauses irreversible ionization of the cell’s DNA, which induces its apoptosis. The main isotopes used\ntoday are iodine-131, yttrium-90, lutetium-177 and, to a lesser extent, rhenium-188 [ 158]. As mentioned\nearlier, the purpose of the DOTA-SSA design was to work with a chelating cavity capable of complexing\nradioelements for imaging or therapy. Consequently, most of the platforms discussed above have been\ntransposed for therapeutic application via the use of β−emitters [64,74,81,82].\n3.2.1. Yttrium-90 and Lutetium-177\nYttrium-90, a pure high energy β−emitter (T 1/2=64 h, E βmax=2.28 MeV), and lutetium-177,\na medium energy β−emitter (T 1/2=6.7 d, E βmax=0.5 MeV) with a γcomponent (208 keV), are\ncurrently the most used in PRRT. Each of these two elements has its own advantages for targeted\ntherapy. The particles emitted by90Y are more energetic and more penetrating; they are able to di ﬀuse\non a thicker layer of cells, which is an advantage for the treatment of large tumors. However, even if\nhigh energy radiation allows a more uniform irradiation of the tumor, the risk of imposing an excessive\ndose of radiation on the adjacent tissues is very present. For its part, the177Lu emits less energetic\nradiation, more suited to small tumors. In addition, the energy of its γradiation is su ﬃcient to allow\ndetection by scintigraphy and establish dosimetry during the therapy sequences [159].\nThe ﬁrst analog to be studied was [90Y]-DOTATOC (Octreother®), and the ﬁrst treatment sessions\nquickly showed good results, stopping the progression of the tumor [ 72,160,161]. Many studies on this\nlong-used treatment have made it possible to observe a good tolerance for this radiotracer, with fairly\nmild side e ﬀects (fatigue) and in very rare cases a little more severe ones (nausea). However, it also\nshowed some toxicity for the kidneys and the bones, these two aspects being the dose-limiting factors\nfor the patient. In vitro , a greater a ﬃnity for SSTR2 has been demonstrated for [90Y]-DOTATATE\ncompared to [90Y]-DOTATOC [ 64]. However, for the diagnosis in humans, a better contrast between\nthe kidneys and the tumor was found for [111In]-DOTATOC compared to [111In]-DOTATATE [ 73],\nwhich may explain the wider use of DOTATOC analog. Despite this, these two analogs have relatively\nsimilar properties and have proven to be e ﬀective treatment methods that improve survival in some\npatients with neuroendocrine tumors (approximately 50 months vs. 18 months without treatment) [ 162].\nIn a Phase IIA study with [90Y]-DOTALAN (MAURITIUS trial), this one demonstrated lower tumor\nuptake in neuroendocrine tumors compared to90Y-DOTATOC, but could be of potential interest for\nother tumors, such as HCC or lung cancers [ 163]. With the perspective of several years of clinical use,\nPRRT with90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs appears to be well-tolerated with favorable long-term\noutcome.']"

Nach der Bindung an den Rezeptor werden die Radiopharmaka in die Zelle internalisiert, wo sie DNA-Schäden verursachen, die zum Zelltod führen können (Hirmas et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation-\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells.

Healthy non-diseased organs can also express\nSSTR subtypes, as can be seen in the healthy liver, spleen, pituitary, salivary glands, thyroid,\nadrenals, kidney, prostate, pancreas, intestine and blood vessels [ 7–9]. The antitumoral\neffect of PRRT is triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage. After binding to the SSTR 2,\nthe radiopharmaceutical agonists are internalized into the tumor cell where the irradiation\ninduces different types of DNA damage such as DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA\ndouble strand breaks (DSBs) of which the latter are the major contributors to tumor cell\ndeath induction [10,11] (Figure 1).\nCancers 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  2 of 18  \n SSAs target the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over -expressed on the can-\ncer cell surface [4] .

Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option.

The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14].

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1).

Administration concomitant\npositively charged aminoacids (lysine or arginine) is systematically carried out and reduces\nPRRT induced renal toxicity. The realization of PRRT requires a relatively normal renal\nfunction (glomerular ﬁltration rate > 50 mL/min), a positive SSTR-based imaging (at least\none grade 2 absorption according to Krenning’s score corresponding to equal or greater\nabsorption to normal liver parenchyma) and normal medullary function.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']"

Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']"

However, in the literature, the term \ntheranostics  has been more frequently associated \nwith some in vivo nuclear medicine oncologic \napplications; this scenario exemplifies the modern \nconcept of theranostics and is the main focus of \ndiscussion in this article. Therefore, throughout \nthis article, theranostics  will be used in reference to \nnuclear medicine theranostics specifically.\nContextualization of Nuclear \nTheranostics\nNuclear medicine imaging is mainly based on \nthe principle of using radioactive isotopes linked \nto specific molecules (ie, radiopharmaceutical \nagents or radiotracers) to assess key biologic \npathways, especially the pathophysiologic features \nof diseases (8). Therapy in nuclear medicine acts \nin the same way: Radiopharmaceutical agents \nare used to target diseased tissue, with radiation \napplied at the cellular level by way of a specific \nchemical and/or biologic affinity. The imaging or \ntherapeutic capability of each radioisotope is de-\ntermined according to the type of radiation emit-\nted because electromagnetic radiation (ie, γ rays) \ncan be detected by imaging systems (scintigraphy, \nSPECT, and PET), and particulate irradiations \nhave cytotoxic (ie, therapeutic) properties (Fig 1).\nThere are two main forms of particulate radia -\ntion used for therapeutic applications: radiation \nwith α particles and radiation with β particles \n(which are electrons). These two forms of radia -\ntion share a common feature: a high transfer of \nenergy to tissues that leads to severe cellular injury \ndue to DNA damage. The α particles have higher \nenergy and much greater mass. Some isotopes (eg, \nlutetium 177 [177Lu]) can emit both electromag -comprehension, discovery, and design of drugs, \nserving as the basis of modern chemotherapy and \ntargeted therapies in medicine (2). More than \n100 years after being proposed, the magic bullet \nconcept remains current and influences the search \nand development of specific effective and harmless \nmolecule-driven treatments for human diseases, \nmost notably cancer. Recently, terms such as \npersonalized medicine, targeted medicine, and precision \nmedicine  have been used to represent this idea.\nAs a central component of patient care, imag-\ning has followed, and often made possible, dis-\ncoveries of drugs and treatments, evolving from a \nvaluable diagnostic tool to a now powerful guide \nfor enhancing disease characterization, patient \nselection, prediction of treatment response and \ntissue toxicity, and determination of the prog-\nnosis (3,4). In summary, imaging is integrated \ninto therapy now more than ever before. In this \ncontext, an approach referred to as theranostics \nhas been frequently used.

Nuclear medicine, particularly with regard to applications \nin oncology, is currently one of the greatest components of the \ntheranostic concept in clinical and research scenarios. Theranostics \nin nuclear medicine, or nuclear theranostics, refers to the use of \nradioactive compounds to image biologic phenomena by means of \nexpression of specific disease targets such as cell surface receptors \nor membrane transporters, and then to use specifically designed \nagents to deliver ionizing radiation to the tissues that express these \ntargets.
