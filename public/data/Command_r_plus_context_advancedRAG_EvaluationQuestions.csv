Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are epithelialneoplasms with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation,\ncan arise in most organs [ 1]. NETs are variable in their pre-\nsentation and are divided into functioning tumors and non-\nfunctioning tumors. Functioning tumors produce peptide oramines that can cause distinct clinical symptoms such asflushing, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, gastric ulcers, or skin rash.Nonfunctioning tumors on the other hand are more common\nand usually present with a large mass or bleeding, and are\nsomewhat difficult to differentiate from a classical cancer[2]. Even though clinical and pathologic features of these tu-\nmors are specific to the site of origin, some other characteris-tics are shared, regardless of site [ 1].\nIn the gastrointestinal system particularly, the most common\nmalignant NETs arise from the midgut (henceforth the focus ofthis paper). For patients presenting with metastatic disease, the\n5-year survival rate is less than 50% [ 3,4]. Their classification\nwas introduced by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor\nS o c i e t y( E N E T S )i n2 0 0 6a n d2 0 0 7[ 5,6], but an optimal cutoff\nvalue for the Ki-67 labeling index to distinguish differentgrades of gastroentero-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) has notbeen conclusively established. However, the ENETS,\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), and the 2010\nWHO classification include a K i-67 labeling cutoff of < 3% to\ndefine low-grade (G1), 3 –20% for intermediate-grade (G2), and\n> 20% for high-grade (G3) NETs (Table 1)[5,6].', 'Quality of Life\nPatients ’quality of life (QOL) is a vital aspect to look at after\ntreatment with PRRT. Improvement is usually encountered\nafter treatment with this modality. A study was run by Khan\nand his colleagues [ 58] and included 265 patients with inop-\nerable metastatic GEP or bronchial NETs after177Lu-\noctreotate therapy. The study showed that symptoms im-proved significantly, regardless of the treatment outcome.One way to assess QOL of cancer patients is using the\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of\nCancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ)-coremodule (C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a sensitive instrument\nfor measuring changes in patients ’performance status [ 59].\nConclusion\n177Lu PRRT is a new and promising treatment for patients\nwith NETs, particularly those with grades 1 and 2, who are\ninoperable and have failed treatment with SSAs. In general,\nPRRT is well-tolerated and side effects are usually self-\nlimiting in nature. It can be used as neoadjuvant treatment inpatients with inoperable GEP-NETs, and as adjuvant therapy\nafter surgical intervention. Combination treatments of PRRT\nwith chemotherapy or targeted agents, as well as combinations\nof radionuclides in patients with NETs have been explored to\nsome limits over the last few years. Retreatment with extracycles of PRRT as salvage therapy has been evaluated in small\nretrospective series as well. Overall, there is evidence that\ndisease control and quality of life improve significantly after\n177Lu PRRT therapy. The majority of patients with NETs ex-\nperience partial responses or have disease stabilization; some30% of patients, however, will have disease progression.\nIt is obvious from the literature review performed in this\npaper that there are a limited number of clinical trials conduct-ed so far. This highlights the fact that there is still a need forlarge, prospective, multi-center, and controlled trials with sev-\neral years of follow-up to contribute to current findings, and\nallow for the integration of PRRT in the treatment of NETs inclinical practice guidelines. NETTER-1 trial has provided a\ngood level of evidence for the use of PRRT in GEP-NETs, and\nthis approach should be duplicated in other potential indica-tions for PRRT in NETs.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflict of Interest Nader Hirmas, Raya Jadaan, and Akram Al-\nIbraheem declare no conflict of interest.\nEthical Approval This article does not contain any studies with human\nparticipants or animals performed by any of the authors.References\n1.

Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization.

The two most commonly used radio-peptides for radionuclide therapy in\nneuroendocrine tumors are90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. Radio-peptides have been used for\nseveral years in the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Recently, the randomized Phase\nIII study NETTER-1 compared177Lu-DOTATATE versus high-dose (double-dose) octreotide LAR in\npatients with metastatic midgut neuroendocrine tumors, and demonstrated its efﬁcacy in this setting.\nStrong signals in favor of efﬁciency seem to exist for other tumors, in particular for pancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. This focus on radionuclide therapy in gastroenteropancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors addresses the treatment modalities, the validated and potential\nindications, and the safety of the therapy.\nKeywords: neuroendocrine tumors; neoplasm metastasis; PRRT; peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy; gastroenteropancreatic tumor; pulmonary tumor\n1.', 'FOCUS ON MOLECULAR IMAGING\nNew Developments in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\nGuillaume P.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

A second generation pure no-carrier-added Lu-\n177 has a high speci ﬁc activity and has waste disposal advantages over the ﬁrst\ngeneration carrier-added Lu-177. PRRT has recently been developed for the\ntreatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The majority of pancreatic and\ngastroenteric NETs (GEP-NETs) express the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) 2\nand 5. These receptors can be speci ﬁcally targeted with a somatostatin peptide\nanalogue (DOTATOC/DOTATATE) which can be chelated to a positron\nemission tomography (PET) emitting radioisotope such as Ga-68 for imaging\nor to a b-emitting radioisotope Lu-177 for therapy. A key advantage of this\napproach is that the receptor expression can be demonstrated by PET imaging\nbefore the patient is treated. Clinical studies in G1 and G2 GEP-NETS have\ndemonstrated that PRRT is extremely effective in terms of progression free\nsurvival (PFS), symptom control and quality of life, with a well-established safety\nproﬁle. A bene ﬁcial effect on outcome survival awaits to be con ﬁrmed. The ﬁrst\ncommercially available product Lu-177-DOTATATE was approved followingthe NETTER-1 trial in G1 and G2 GE-NETS. Lu-177-DOTATATE 7,4 GBq every 8\nweeks for 4 cycles, together with octreotide LAR 30 mg monthly,\ndemonstrated a median PFS of 28,4 months compared to 8,5 months for\noctreotide LAR 60 mg monthly. A second pivotal study COMPETE is currently in\nprogress, comparing no carrier-added (n.c.a.) Lu-177-DOTATOC to the m-\nTOR inhibitor Everolimus in both GE-NETs and PNETs. Two studies, NETTER-2\nand COMPOSE are currently underway in patients with high grade G2 and G3\nNETs. Novel SSTR antagonists are being developed as next generation targeting\nmolecules for SSTR2-expressing tumors. Antagonists have a higher tumor\nbinding to receptors than agonists, opening up the potential indications for\nSSTR2 targeting to tumors which have a relatively lower expression of SSTR2\ncompared to NET such as small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and\nbreast cancer. In addition to Lu-177, radioisotopes with different radiation\nproperties such as Tb-161 and the a-emitter Ac-225 are being developed\nwhich have the potential to improve treatment ef ﬁcacy across the range of G1\nto G3 NETs.\nKEYWORDS\npeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT),\nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs), Lutetium-177, Ga-68 PET, dosimetry\nFrontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin.org 01\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nElcin Zan,\nNew York University, United States\nREVIEWED BY\nCarsten Grötzinger,\nCharite ´Universitätsmedizin Berlin,\nGermany\nAlan Harris,\nNew York University, United States\nRoberta Modica,\nUniversity of Naples Federico II, Italy\nRaj Srirajaskanthan,\nKing ’s College London,\nUnited Kingdom\n*CORRESPONDENCE\nPhilip E.

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'J.

The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Journal of\nClinical Medicine\nReview\nIndications of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)\nin Gastroenteropancreatic and Pulmonary Neuroendocrine\nT umors: An Updated Review\nBaptiste Camus1,2,†, Anne-S égolène Cottereau2,3,†, Lola-Jade Palmieri1,2, Sol ène Dermine1,2\n,\nFlorence Tenenbaum3, Catherine Brezault1,2and Romain Coriat1,2,*\n/gid00030/gid00035/gid00032/gid00030/gid00038/gid00001/gid00033/gid00042/gid00045 /gid00001\n/gid00048/gid00043/gid00031/gid00028/gid00047/gid00032/gid00046\nCitation: Camus, B.; Cottereau, A.-S.;\nPalmieri, L.-J.; Dermine, S.;\nTenenbaum, F.; Brezault, C.; Coriat, R.\nIndications of Peptide Receptor\nRadionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in\nGastroenteropancreatic and\nPulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors:\nAn Updated Review.

The two most commonly used radio-peptides for radionuclide therapy in\nneuroendocrine tumors are90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. Radio-peptides have been used for\nseveral years in the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

P eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has gained momentum\nover the past two decades in patients who progress on SSAs. 177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the most widely used radiopeptide for\nPRRT. We reviewed the recent evidence on PRRT and the treatment of gastroentero-pancreatic neuroe ndocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).\nResults177Lu-DOTATATE can be used as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with inoperable GEP-NETs, who might be candidate\nfor surgery after treatment and as adjuvant therapy after surgical intervention. Combination treatments of PRRT with chemo-\ntherapy or targeted agents as well as combinations of radionuclides in patients with NETs have been explored over the last few\nyears. The majority of patients with NETs experience partial response or have disease stabilization, a small percentage has\ncomplete response, while some 30% of patients, however, will have disease progression. The safety and efficacy of retreatmentwith extra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy have been evaluated in small retrospective series.\nConclusion Overall, there is evidence that disease control and quality of life improve significantly after 117Lu PRRT therapy.\nClinical trials on this therapy are scarce, and there is a need for further studies to establish proper management guidelines.\nKeywords Nuclear medicine .Theranostics .Lutetium .Neuroendocrine tumors .Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy\nIntroduction to NETs and Current Lines\nof Treatment\nNeuroendocrine cells are distributed widely throughout the\nbody. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are epithelialneoplasms with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation,\ncan arise in most organs [ 1]. NETs are variable in their pre-\nsentation and are divided into functioning tumors and non-\nfunctioning tumors. Functioning tumors produce peptide oramines that can cause distinct clinical symptoms such asflushing, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, gastric ulcers, or skin rash.Nonfunctioning tumors on the other hand are more common\nand usually present with a large mass or bleeding, and are\nsomewhat difficult to differentiate from a classical cancer[2]. Even though clinical and pathologic features of these tu-\nmors are specific to the site of origin, some other characteris-tics are shared, regardless of site [ 1].\nIn the gastrointestinal system particularly, the most common\nmalignant NETs arise from the midgut (henceforth the focus ofthis paper). For patients presenting with metastatic disease, the\n5-year survival rate is less than 50% [ 3,4]. Their classification\nwas introduced by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor\nS o c i e t y( E N E T S )i n2 0 0 6a n d2 0 0 7[ 5,6], but an optimal cutoff\nvalue for the Ki-67 labeling index to distinguish differentgrades of gastroentero-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) has notbeen conclusively established. However, the ENETS,\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), and the 2010\nWHO classification include a K i-67 labeling cutoff of < 3% to\ndefine low-grade (G1), 3 –20% for intermediate-grade (G2), and\n> 20% for high-grade (G3) NETs (Table 1)[5,6].']"

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 12 of 15\n5. Perspectives, Ongoing Studies\nThe role of PRRT in NETs is evolving. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization.

Howe, MD\nDepartment of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology and Endocrine Surgery, University of Iowa Carver College of\nMedicine, Iowa City, IA\nPatients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) generally\nhave long survival, even when they present with advanceddisease. There are many treatment options for advanced\ngastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEPNETs), including sur-\ngical resection of the primary and cytoreduction ofmetastases, somatostatin analogs (SSAs), targeted therapy\n(TT), chemotherapy (CT), hepatic embolotherapy, and\npeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). For patientswith advanced or metastatic NETs, SSAs are usually the\nﬁrst line of therapy, based upon the improvement found for\nprogression-free survival (PFS) relative to placebo in thePROMID\n1and CLARINET trials.2An important unan-\nswered question in these patients is the selection of the next\ntreatment upon progression. This choice is inﬂuenced bymany factors, including the type of tumor (pancreatic vs\nintestinal NET), tumor grade and differentiation, patient\ncomorbidities, as well as the medical specialties andspeciﬁc centers seeing the patient.\nSince FDA approval of\n177Lu-DOTATATE in the Uni-\nted States in 2018, and for over two decades in Europe,PRRT has been an option for patients with progression of\nGEPNETs.\n3–5The efﬁcacy of PRRT plus intermediate dose\nSSA for improving PFS of patients with advanced midguttumors as compared to high dose SSA was established in\nthe NETTER-1 trial, resulting in a median PFS of 25.0 and\n8.5 months, respectively.\n6,7In longer-term follow-up\n(median 76 months), the median overall survival (OS) was\nnot signiﬁcantly different between these 2 groups (48 and\n36 months, respectively; p= 0.30), but 36% of patients inthe high dose SSA group crossed over to receive PRRT.8\nTargeted therapies have also shown promise for treatment\nof progressive NETs. The mTOR pathway-targeted ever-\nolimus modestly improved PFS in lung, GI, and pancreatic\nNET patients,9,10and the VEGF-directed tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor sunitinib led to PFS beneﬁt in pancreatic NETs.11\nThe chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine and temo-zolomide improved PFS in pancreatic NET patients overtemozolomide alone, with response rates of 33%.\n12How-\never, most experts acknowledge that there are no clear\nguidelines for which therapy should be used and in whatorder for patients with progressive GEPNETs.\n13\nA recent paper by Pusceddu et al. retrospectively eval-\nuated 508 patients with unresectable, locally advanced ormetastatic GEPNETs who progressed on treatment with\nSSAs in 25 Italian centers between 2000 and 2020.\n14Of\nthese, 329 were treated with PRRT on progression (45%with\n177Lu, 19% with90Y, and 33% with both isotopes),\nand 179 had targeted therapy or chemotherapy (TT/CT).\nThe main endpoint of the study was to look at PFS in thesetwo groups. Although overall survival is a desirable end-\npoint in many cancers, this has proven to be very\nchallenging in NET studies. Patients often live for a longtime, and therefore may receive many different therapies\nand follow-up must be long. Cross-over from one therapy\nto another is common, such as from PRRT to TT/CT or thereverse. Another confounder is that these studies are ret-\nrospective, leading to bias as to which therapy is given ﬁrst,\nas well as other factors, such as whether patients are\nreferred for primary tumor resection and/or cytoreduction\nof metastases. Given these limitations of a retrospectivemulti-institutional study, the authors sought to improve\ntheir comparisons by using propensity-matching based\nupon 18 patient, tumor, and treatment factors.']"

5G advanced RAG,Wie viele PRRT-Behandlungen kann man bekommen?,german,specific,therapy,command-r-plus advanced RAG,Vier bis fünf Zyklen.,,,,"['Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h.

5E advanced RAG,How many PRRT treatments can you have?,english,specific,therapy,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"There is no definitive answer provided in the context, however, it mentions that PRRT can be repeated in cases of progression after effective initial radioisotope therapy. The number of treatments is not specified, but it is referred to as ""re-treatment"" or ""retreatment,"" suggesting it is more than one additional treatment. The context also mentions a meta-analysis by Strosberg et al. that discusses the effects of re-PRRT, indicating that multiple repeat treatments are possible.

In 2019, Zhang et al. reported the results of PRRT with177Lu/\n90Y- (DOTATATE or DOTATOC) in 69 patients, including\n46 patients with Pan-NET. Promis ing results have been obtained\nespecially in patients with Ki-67 ≤55%.53Carlsen et al. published a\nstudy of NET G3 and NEC where 89 patients were G3 Pan-NET orPan-NEC and they found promising response rates in these highly\nselected patient populations.\n54Similar results were obtained by\nThang et al. in a group of 17 patients (17/28) with G3 Pan-NETwith or without radiosensitising chemotherapy.\n55Nevertheless, it\nis necessary to perform prospective studies to fully define the role\nof PRRT in Pan-NET G3.\nPRRT can be used in the treatment of NF-Pan-NET G3 with high\nSST expression only within clinical trials. Currently, the NETTER-2 trial\n(clinicaltrials.gov NCT03972488) comparing PRRT with high-dose\noctreotide LAR completed the accrual and its results are waiting.

Basedon data from 3 NET- referral centres (Erasmus, Rotterdam;\nRoyal Free, London; and University of Bonn, with a total of\n224 patients), the median PFS was 12.5 months and the safetyprofile of\n177Lu-PRRT retreatment was similar to the initial PRRT\ntreatment.60\nIn the case of progression after effective radioisotope therapy\nlasting for a year or more, a repetition of PRRT may be considered.However, repeated PRRT is associated with a shorter PFS.\n56–58If a\ndecision is made to repeat PRRT-due to the greater toxicity of90Y-the\nuse of177Lu is recommended.

Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.', 'Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39]. These results suggest an imputability of alkylating agents\nassociated with PRRT as only 1% of the patients treated only by alkylating chemotherapy\ndeveloped myelodysplastic syndrome. This difference in rates reported by Brieau et al. and\nthe different retrospective studies could be linked to the performing primary chemotherapy.\nThese data are in favor of PRRT treatment prior to chemotherapy.\nWhereas a blood RNA assay has been developed to predict tumour response to PRRT,\nno molecular markers have been found to predict PRRT toxicity [40].']"

The most often used method of infusion is thegravity method, by which the complete dose is effectively adminis-tered exponentially. However, there is no evidence to explicitly sup-\nport an infusion time of 30 min. This study aims to investigate the\nsafety of an infusion time of less than 5 min. Methods: A cohort study\nwas performed, examining the biochemical and clinical toxicity afterPRRT when using a fast-infusion protocol with a maximum infusion\ntime of 5 min. Data on patient characteristics, laboratory tests, follow-\nup visits, and pre- and posttreatment imaging using\n68Ga-DOTATOC\nPET/CT from patients treated with PRRT at the University MedicalCenter Utrecht (UMC Utrecht) were collected. All patients receiving\nPRRT using the fast-infusion protocol were included. If no laboratory\nor clinical follow-up was available, patients were excluded. In addition,a laboratory experiment was performed, simulating the standard-infu-\nsion protocol using the gravity method. Results: Thirty-one patients,\ntreated using the fast-infusion protocol, were included. Clinical toxicitymainly consisted of grade 1/2 fatigue (87.1%) and grade 1 nausea orvomiting (67.7%) during follow-up. No acute or long-term clinical tox-\nicity possibly related to the fast-infusion protocol was reported. Grade\n3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred after PRRT in 1 patient (3.2%). Nograde 3/4 renal toxicity occurred. The laboratory experiment showedthat when using the gravity method for infusion, half of the activity is\ninfused after 3.5 min, and 95% is infused within 15 min. Conclusion:\nA faster infusion of PRRT using an infusion time of less than 5 min issafe and feasible in clinical practice.\nKey Words : peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; infusion protocol;\n177Lu-DOTATATE; fast infusion\nJ Nucl Med 2021; 62:816 –822\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.120.252494\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with177Lu-\nDOTATATE/DOTATOC/HA-DOTATATE is increasingly be-ing used for treatment of inoperable grade I/II neuroendocrine\nneoplasms (NENs) ( 1–4). PRRT uses the radioactive isotope\n177Lu, coupled to a peptide that mainly targets somatostatin sub-\ntype 2 receptors. These receptors are often highly overexpressedon the cell surface of NENs and some other type of tumors(5,6). The radiopharmaceutical binds to the receptor with high\nafﬁnity and is internalized by the tumor cells after intravenous\nadministration. The presence of the somatostatin subtype 2 re-\nceptors can easily be made visible by\n68Ga-somatostatin receptor\nPET/CT (68Ga-SSTR PET/CT) ( 7). The treatment is safe, as tox-\nicity is limited to grade I –II hematotoxicity in less than 10% of pa-\ntients and is often transient ( 3,8,9). Grade III or IV hematotoxicity\nor a decreased renal function rarely occur after treatment with\nPRRT.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

Consequently, it is essential for the efﬁcacy of the therapy that both\ntumors and their metastases express SSTR, and show intense uptake on somatostatin\nreceptor imaging (Figure 4) [51,52].\nBiomedicines 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 15 \n \never, so far, pasireotide has not proven superi or to octreotide or lanreotide in antisecre-\ntory or antiproliferative therapy.

Many studies on this\nlong-used treatment have made it possible to observe a good tolerance for this radiotracer, with fairly\nmild side e ﬀects (fatigue) and in very rare cases a little more severe ones (nausea). However, it also\nshowed some toxicity for the kidneys and the bones, these two aspects being the dose-limiting factors\nfor the patient. In vitro , a greater a ﬃnity for SSTR2 has been demonstrated for [90Y]-DOTATATE\ncompared to [90Y]-DOTATOC [ 64]. However, for the diagnosis in humans, a better contrast between\nthe kidneys and the tumor was found for [111In]-DOTATOC compared to [111In]-DOTATATE [ 73],\nwhich may explain the wider use of DOTATOC analog. Despite this, these two analogs have relatively\nsimilar properties and have proven to be e ﬀective treatment methods that improve survival in some\npatients with neuroendocrine tumors (approximately 50 months vs. 18 months without treatment) [ 162].\nIn a Phase IIA study with [90Y]-DOTALAN (MAURITIUS trial), this one demonstrated lower tumor\nuptake in neuroendocrine tumors compared to90Y-DOTATOC, but could be of potential interest for\nother tumors, such as HCC or lung cancers [ 163]. With the perspective of several years of clinical use,\nPRRT with90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs appears to be well-tolerated with favorable long-term\noutcome.']"

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Oncotarget16943\nwww.oncotarget.com\nand creatinine levels were determined before and after \nPRRT. After the initial PRRT (1048 cycles), grade 3 and 4 \nadverse events were rare. Dialysis was performed before \nPRRT in 3 patients and continued thereafter. After 2633 \nfollow-up cycles, grade 3 and 4 adverse events were still \nprevalent in less than 1% of patients. Laboratory values \nwere then studied across all 3692 cycles. Here, grade 3 \nand 4 adverse events did not increase and were still below \n1%. Missing values were less than 1% (Table 3). Dialysis \nwas necessary at any time after PRRT in additional 5 \npatients of 1048 (0.4%) patients. During follow-up, MDS \nor leukemia developed in 22 (2%) patients (Table 4), \nwhich developed after a mean of 8 years after diagnosis \nof the neuroendocrine neoplasia and was most prevalent \nin patients with NEN of pancreatic or small bowel. \nPossible risk factors included previous chemotherapy and \nexternal beam radiation. Most patients developing MDS or \nleukemia had a high tumor load with hepatic metastases. \nPrognosis of patients with MDS/leukemia was dismal with \na mean overall survival of 14.4 months after diagnosis \n(Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nIn our study, we report OS, PFS and adverse \nevents of 1048 patients treated by PRRT over ten years. \nLimitations of our study is it retrospective nature and \nlack of control arms and random selectin for therapies. \nOn the other hand, this is a large selection of patients \ntreated in day-today practice yielding results useful in \nclinical settings. Just more than half of the cohort has \nsurvived during follow-up yielding exact overall survival \ndata of patients and sub-groups. To ensure that all \ndeceased patients were included in the analysis, several \ntracking mechanisms were employed at our institution as \ndescribed above. Compared to historical controls [11], OS observed in our study is favorable implying that \nPRRT is effective. On the other hand, OS observed in our \nstudy may be mainly related to better differentiation of \nNEN since we included only patients with somatostatin \nreceptor-expressing NEN. However, there appears to be no \nsurvival advantage of patients with somatostatin receptor-\nexpressing mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors compared to \nnon-expressing tumors [18].\nTreatment with both radioisotopes resulted in better \nOS than with 177Lu or 90Y solely. These results were also \nreported in another study. Combined application of 90Y- \nand 177Lu-based PRRT in patients with different NENs \nresulted in a median OS of 66.1 months [19], which is \nalmost identical to the median OS of 64 months in our \nstudy. These results indicate that personalized treatment \nadapting radioisotopes and dose to tumor load and location \nis superior than more restricted protocols. However, it \nshould be noted that PRRT as monotherapy may be not as \neffective as combinatory protocols using radiosensitizers \nsuch as Everolimus (Afinitor®) or a combination of \ncapecitabine and temozolomide achieving higher response \nrates compared to PRRT alone [20, 21].\nAnother molecular target, the serine-threonine \nkinase mTOR plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of NENs \nand is effectively inhibited by Everolimus (Afinitor®). \nA prospective placebo-controlled multi-center trial in \npatients with pancreatic NENs has shown prolongation of \nPFS in patients treated with Everolimus (Afinitor®) versus \npatients treated with placebo (11.0 versus 4.6 months). \nAlthough median PFS in patients treated with Everolimus \n(Afinitor®) is lower in patients with pancreatic NENs \nthan 20 months observed in our study, a recent analysis \nhas shown that patients treated initially with Everolimus \n(Afinitor®) have a median OS of 44 months [22], which \ncorresponds exactly to the median OS in our study.', '[ 36] was published\nlater after 4 years of follow-up on patients with pNETs aloneTable 3 Summary of clinical studies on PRRT using177Lu-DOTATATE\nCenter (reference, year) Patient\nnumberTumor response\nCR,n(%) PR, n(%) MR, n(%) SD, n(%) PD, n(%) CR + PR + MR + SD, n(%)\nRotterdam (Kwekkeboom et al [ 46], 2008) 310 5 (2) 86 (28) 51 (16) 107 (35) 61 (20) 240 (80)\nGothenburg (Swärd et al.

Hematological Toxicity\nPRRT can induce hematological toxicity through bone marrow radiation. The vast\nmajority of patients only have mild and reversible hematological toxicity with a nadir at\n4–6 weeks after administration of PRRT [ 27,36,50]. However, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,\nthrombocytopenia or leukopenia have been observed in, respectively, 1%, 2% and 1% of\nthe patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE in the NETTER-1 trial [ 27]. PRRT-induced\nsevere lymphopenia is the most common hematological toxicity [ 27,29], but it has not been\nassociated with increased susceptibility for infections [90]. Thrombocytopenia is the most\ncommon cause of dose reduction in PRRT, whereas bleeding complications are rare [ 27].\nCaution should be taken in patients with widespread bone metastases (Figure 2A), due\nto the risk of persistent cytopenia. In the absence of alternative treatment options, PRRT\nshould preferably be initiated at half the regular activity (3.7 GBq)177Lu-DOTATATE in\nthese patients. Additionally, there is a relevant long-term risk of 2% for the development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 1% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after\nPRRT [ 27,29,91]. Little is known about the pathophysiology of persistent hematological\ntoxicity, but a role for clonal hematopoiesis has been postulated [ 92]. Known risk factors\nfor severe hematological toxicity include decreased renal function, pre-existent cytopenias,\nextensive tumor mass, age over 70, extensive bone metastases and pre-treatment with\nmyelotoxic chemotherapy [ 91,93,94]. Additionally, women are at higher risk for developing\nsubacute grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia than men, which was independent from other risk\nfactors in a multivariable analysis [89].\n8.2. Nephrotoxicity\nDue to SSTR expression in the kidneys and the renal excretion of radiolabeled SSAs, the\nkidneys receive a high radiation dose during PRRT. Following glomerular filtration, SSAs are re-\nabsorbed in the proximal tubuli of the renal cortex because of active transport mechanisms [ 95].\nBy saturating this re-uptake mechanism through the use of lysine and arginine, re-absorption of\nradiolabeled peptides can be significantly reduced. This results in less radiation-induced nephro-\ntoxicity by a reduction of the absorbed kidney dose up to 40% [ 96,97]. However, nephrotoxicity\nafter PRRT still occurs such as tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy and thrombotic microan-\ngiopathy [ 98]. In the NETTER-1 study , grade ≥3 renal toxicity was observed in 5% of the\n177Lu-DOTATATE group and in 4% of the control group [ 30]. Bergsma et al. reported an overall\ncreatinine clearance loss of 3.4% 1 year after PRRT. No subacute grade ≥3 renal toxicity was\nseen and 1.5% of the patients showed grade 3 renal toxicity in the long term. However, all these\npatients had a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min at baseline [ 99]. A reduced kidney function\ncan lead to a delayed renal excretion of177Lu-DOTATATE and this has also been associated with\na higher risk of hematological toxicity [ 95]. Risk factors associated with renal toxicity include\nage > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal disease, cumulative radiation\ndose to the kidneys, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy , tumor or metastases close to the\nkidney and previous PRRT with90Y-DOTATOC [ 100]. Post-renal obstruction can be observed in\nsome GEP-NET patients, particularly in those with retroperitoneal or pelvic metastases, but this\ncan also be caused by the primary tumor, nephrolithiasis and abdominal or retroperitoneal fi-\nbrosis [ 101].', 'When appropriate patient selection is performed, PRRT is accompanied by limited risks\nfor renal and hematological toxicities.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).', '[26] and Kesavan & Turner [25] reporting \nrates of 2% and 1.4%, respectively which corresponds to \nthe 2.1% in our study. Risk factors identified in our study \nwere chemotherapy and external beam radiation, as well \nas high tumor loads defined as involvement of more than \n50% of the liver, multiple/multifocal (<10) bone and \nlymph node metatases. Development of leukemia/MDS \nafter PRRT is associated with a limited mean overall \nsurvival of 14.4 months in our study. Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 11 of 17\nof patients treated with PRRT who had mesenteric and/or peritoneal metastases ranged\nfrom 6–51% [ 27,117,118]. In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

9E advanced RAG,Is PRRT the future for metastatic cancer patients?,english,general,therapy,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"PRRT is a promising treatment option for metastatic cancer, particularly neuroendocrine neoplasms, with high response rates and improved progression-free survival. However, more randomized controlled trials are needed to establish its position compared to other established treatments. (Rogoza et al., 2022; Nicolas et al., 2019; Camus et al., 2021)",,,,"['PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs. However, PRRT has not been directly compared to any other\nestablished regimen. PRRT outperformed SSA, everolimus, sunitinib, everolimus + SSA ,\nand everolimus + bevacizumab in terms of PFS. PRRT had the highest probability (96%)\nof being the most effective treatment in terms of improving PFS and posing a low risk of\nSAEs based on cluster ranking [129].\nOnly SSTR agonists have been labelled with beta-emitters thus far. SSTR antagonists\nare expected to have a higher afﬁnity for somatostatin-positive tumour cells, resulting in\nan increase in the radiation dose delivered to the tumour. Another intriguing approach\nis to use alpha emitters such as Bismuth-213 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n245 min) or\nActinium-225 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n210 d) as a targeted alpha particle therapy (TAT).\nTAT treatment has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the treatment of the\ncastration-resistant prostate cancer-expressing 177Luprostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen.\nThe advantage, it has been hypothesized, is a shallow tissue penetration depth combined', 'FOCUS ON MOLECULAR IMAGING\nNew Developments in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\nGuillaume P.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 12 of 15\n5. Perspectives, Ongoing Studies\nThe role of PRRT in NETs is evolving. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization. A key\nchallenge remains to identify biomarkers, from imaging and molecular data, to predict\nPRRT response, towards a personalized treatment plan.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., F.T., and R.C.; methodol-\nogy, B.C., A.-S.C., and R.C.; validation, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; investigation,\nB.C. and A.-S.C.; resources, B.C., A.-S.C., R.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., and F.T.; data curation, B.C. and\nA.-S.C.; writing—original draft preparation, B.C. and A.-S.C.; writing—review and editing, B.C.,\nA.-S.C., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; visualization, R.C.; supervision, RC.; project administration, R.C.

The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients.

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'artery of the tumor resulted in a high local blood concentration of\nthe radiopharmaceutical. When both administration methods werecompared, an 11-fold increase in tumor uptake was quanti ﬁed on\nthe posttreatment\n177Lu planar scintigraphy after intraarterial ad-\nministration. Another reason to shorten the infusion time is the\nfact that the agonist-induced desensitization and internalizationprocess is quick and happens within minutes. Binding of the so-matostatin analog is arguably the most signi ﬁcant within these ﬁrst\nminutes.\nFaster infusion may also affect the work ﬂow of clinical person-\nnel positively. During infusion, careful monitoring of the processis warranted, thus limiting the amount of patients that can betreated simultaneously, depending on the local procedural guide-lines. With a shorter infusion time, a more ef ﬁcient work ﬂow may\nbe possible.\nIn our study, there are some limitations. First, long-term clinical\ntoxicity was not investigated. However, after fast infusion ofPRRT, mainly short-term adverse reactions are of concern. Long-\nterm negative effects of a fast infusion in PRRT are not expected.\nSecond, lymphocyte count was not investigated, as data were notsufﬁciently available. In previous studies, a temporary lymphope-\nnia occurred frequently. Third, response after PRRT was measuredusing\n68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT. Even though this imaging tech-\nnique is a promising tool in the follow-up of PRRT-treated pa-tients, no evidence exists on its validity. In 9 patients, PET/CTscans were not available for response assessment. In 8 patients,\nfollow-up consisted of conventional imaging (i.e., contrast-en-\nhanced CT/MRI), and in 1 patient the image quality of the PET/CT scan was insuf ﬁcient to analyze the response. Fourth, the study\npopulation is heterogeneous, as any type of tumor was included.However, as the aim of the study was toxicity after fast infusion ofPRRT, this does not affect the validity of the study. Last, speci ﬁc\ncharacteristics of different radiopharmaceuticals, such as pH,could in theory affect complaints observed by the patient. In this\nstudy, these factors could not be considered because only 1 radio-\npharmaceutical was used.\nBecause our study is a cohort study, no direct comparison can\nbe made with PRRT using the standard 30-min protocol. In the fu-\nture, a randomized controlled trial could be performed comparingboth infusion protocols to establish ﬁnal certainty on the most ade-\nquate method of infusion in PRRT. Both the effect on toxicity andon response should be investigated, as the effect of fast infusionon the saturation of SSTRs is still unclear.CONCLUSION\nRapid administration of PRRT in 5 min is feasible and can be\nsafely used in standard clinical practice.\nDISCLOSURE\nNo potential con ﬂict of interest relevant to this article was\nreported.\nKEY POINTS\nQUESTION: Is it safe to administer PRRT with an infusion time of\n5m i n ?\nPERTINENT FINDINGS: In a cohort study in which patients with\nNET were treated with PRRT using a fast-infusion protocol, no re-\nlated clinical or biochemical toxicity was found.

The\noligopeptides are designed to target cel-\nlular proteins, commonly cell surfacereceptors, such as the somatostatin recep-\ntor (sstr) subtype 2 (sstr2) that is overex-\npressed on the cell surface of NETs in atumour-specific fashion, thereby ensuring\na high level of specificity in the delivery\nof the radiation to the tumour. Hence,PRRNT is a molecularly targeted radia-\ntion therapy, and thus is distinct from ex-\nternal beam radiation therapy.\nSomatostatin The naturally occurring somatostatin\nmolecule is an oligopeptide comprising\neither 14 or 28 amino acids with alimited half-life in blood due to rapid\nenzymatic degradation. Somatostatin\nexerts an antisecretory endocrine andexocrine effect in addition to tumour\ncell-growth inhibition. Stabilized ana-\nlogues of somatostatin (SSA) showprolonged duration of action [ 1].\nSomatostatin\nreceptorsIn humans five sstr subtypes have been\nidentified. Each sstr is a transmembranemolecule weighing approximately\n80 kDa. Somatostatin exerts its action by\ninhibiting G-protein-dependent 3 ′,5′-\ncyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation\nin a dose-dependent manner atsubnanomolar concentrations. Sstr2 is\noverexpressed in NETs.', 'The radiopharmaceutical binds to the receptor with high\nafﬁnity and is internalized by the tumor cells after intravenous\nadministration. The presence of the somatostatin subtype 2 re-\nceptors can easily be made visible by\n68Ga-somatostatin receptor\nPET/CT (68Ga-SSTR PET/CT) ( 7). The treatment is safe, as tox-\nicity is limited to grade I –II hematotoxicity in less than 10% of pa-\ntients and is often transient ( 3,8,9). Grade III or IV hematotoxicity\nor a decreased renal function rarely occur after treatment with\nPRRT. When PRRT is administered, multiple precautionary meas-\nures are taken to ensure a safe infusion for the patient as well as thehealth-care personnel performing the administration ( 10,11 ). Ac-\ncording to the instructions from the manufacturer of\n177Lu-DOTA-\nTATE (Lutathera; Advanced Accelerator Applications, Novartis),the prescribed method of administration is the so-called gravity\nmethod. This method uses gravity to ﬂush the vial containing the\nradiopharmaceutical with saline solution for injection (0.9 mg/mL),while regulating the ﬂow to a speci ﬁc infusion rate. The instructed\nduration of the infusion is 30 min, during which a constant ﬂow of\n400 mL/h should be maintained. The infusion time was set to be 30\nmin when the ﬁrst results on patients treated with PRRT were\npublished, and all subsequently published protocols adapted this30-min infusion time ( 1,12). However, other administration meth-\nods are considered, often using a pump to ensure a more constantinfusion in PRRT ( 13,14 ). By using a pump, a faster infusion time\ncan be achieved. However, there are concerns when infusing at a\nfaster rate, due to the lack of safety studies. In the current study, we\ninvestigate the safety of a faster infusion in PRRT by analyzing tox-icity pro ﬁles after PRRT using the fast-infusion protocol, in which\na total intravenous infusion time of 5 min is used.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nAll patients treated with PRRT (in-house –labeled177Lu-HA-DOTA-\nTATE; Scintomics) using the fast-infusion protocol (regular care in ourhospital since March 2017) from September 2016 until April 2019were included.\n177Lu-HA-DOTATATE was prepared in house using a\nsemiautomated Modular-Lab eazy synthesis module (Eckert &Ziegler).

Data on patient characteristics, laboratory tests, follow-\nup visits, and pre- and posttreatment imaging using\n68Ga-DOTATOC\nPET/CT from patients treated with PRRT at the University MedicalCenter Utrecht (UMC Utrecht) were collected. All patients receiving\nPRRT using the fast-infusion protocol were included. If no laboratory\nor clinical follow-up was available, patients were excluded. In addition,a laboratory experiment was performed, simulating the standard-infu-\nsion protocol using the gravity method. Results: Thirty-one patients,\ntreated using the fast-infusion protocol, were included. Clinical toxicitymainly consisted of grade 1/2 fatigue (87.1%) and grade 1 nausea orvomiting (67.7%) during follow-up. No acute or long-term clinical tox-\nicity possibly related to the fast-infusion protocol was reported. Grade\n3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred after PRRT in 1 patient (3.2%). Nograde 3/4 renal toxicity occurred. The laboratory experiment showedthat when using the gravity method for infusion, half of the activity is\ninfused after 3.5 min, and 95% is infused within 15 min. Conclusion:\nA faster infusion of PRRT using an infusion time of less than 5 min issafe and feasible in clinical practice.\nKey Words : peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; infusion protocol;\n177Lu-DOTATATE; fast infusion\nJ Nucl Med 2021; 62:816 –822\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.120.252494\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with177Lu-\nDOTATATE/DOTATOC/HA-DOTATATE is increasingly be-ing used for treatment of inoperable grade I/II neuroendocrine\nneoplasms (NENs) ( 1–4). PRRT uses the radioactive isotope\n177Lu, coupled to a peptide that mainly targets somatostatin sub-\ntype 2 receptors. These receptors are often highly overexpressedon the cell surface of NENs and some other type of tumors(5,6). The radiopharmaceutical binds to the receptor with high\nafﬁnity and is internalized by the tumor cells after intravenous\nadministration. The presence of the somatostatin subtype 2 re-\nceptors can easily be made visible by\n68Ga-somatostatin receptor\nPET/CT (68Ga-SSTR PET/CT) ( 7). The treatment is safe, as tox-\nicity is limited to grade I –II hematotoxicity in less than 10% of pa-\ntients and is often transient ( 3,8,9). Grade III or IV hematotoxicity\nor a decreased renal function rarely occur after treatment with\nPRRT. When PRRT is administered, multiple precautionary meas-\nures are taken to ensure a safe infusion for the patient as well as thehealth-care personnel performing the administration ( 10,11 ).']"

The\noligopeptides are designed to target cel-\nlular proteins, commonly cell surfacereceptors, such as the somatostatin recep-\ntor (sstr) subtype 2 (sstr2) that is overex-\npressed on the cell surface of NETs in atumour-specific fashion, thereby ensuring\na high level of specificity in the delivery\nof the radiation to the tumour. Hence,PRRNT is a molecularly targeted radia-\ntion therapy, and thus is distinct from ex-\nternal beam radiation therapy.\nSomatostatin The naturally occurring somatostatin\nmolecule is an oligopeptide comprising\neither 14 or 28 amino acids with alimited half-life in blood due to rapid\nenzymatic degradation. Somatostatin\nexerts an antisecretory endocrine andexocrine effect in addition to tumour\ncell-growth inhibition. Stabilized ana-\nlogues of somatostatin (SSA) showprolonged duration of action [ 1].\nSomatostatin\nreceptorsIn humans five sstr subtypes have been\nidentified. Each sstr is a transmembranemolecule weighing approximately\n80 kDa. Somatostatin exerts its action by\ninhibiting G-protein-dependent 3 ′,5′-\ncyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation\nin a dose-dependent manner atsubnanomolar concentrations. Sstr2 is\noverexpressed in NETs.', '&A patient with pending liver failure should be consid-\nered with caution before being submitted to PRRNT.\nProcedure\nPretherapy assessment\nThe availability of the following information is mandatory\nwhen considering a patient for PRRNT:\n&NET proven by histopathology (immunohistochemistry).\n&High sstr expression determined by functional whole-\nbody imaging with111In-pentetreotide (OctreoScan) or68\nGa-DOTA-peptide PET/CT or immunohistochemistry.\nThe following criteria should be taken into consideration\nwhen deciding whether or not to perform PRRNT.\n&Karnofsky/Lansky performance status above 60 % or\nECOG performance status less than 2.\n&Tumour differentiation, preferably grade 1/2.\n&Tumour proliferation rate, preferably with a Ki-67/mitotic\nindex ≤20 %. In addition, the rate of tumour growth, as\ndetermined by CTor MRI, could be considered. Note that,in general, less-differentiated tumours showing high pro-\nliferation rates are better candidates for chemotherapy.\nFacility and personnel\nPRRNT is still considered an investigational treatment and\nits implementation must comply with national legislation\nand local requirements, as well as with ethical principles\nregarding human studies. The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 6 of 17\nwhich an antiemetic, typically ondansetron or granisetron, should be given prophylactically\nbefore the start of the infusion.177Lu-DOTATATE allows for post-therapy scintigraphy\nwith planar imaging or SPECT/CT. At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5.

Mechanism of Action\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation-\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells. SSTRs are G-protein coupled\nreceptors with ﬁve subtypes of which subtype 2 (SSTR 2) is the most commonly expressed\nin NETs, followed by SSTR 1and SSTR 5[5,6]. Healthy non-diseased organs can also express\nSSTR subtypes, as can be seen in the healthy liver, spleen, pituitary, salivary glands, thyroid,\nadrenals, kidney, prostate, pancreas, intestine and blood vessels [ 7–9]. The antitumoral\neffect of PRRT is triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage. After binding to the SSTR 2,\nthe radiopharmaceutical agonists are internalized into the tumor cell where the irradiation\ninduces different types of DNA damage such as DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA\ndouble strand breaks (DSBs) of which the latter are the major contributors to tumor cell\ndeath induction [10,11] (Figure 1).\nCancers 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  2 of 18  \n SSAs target the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over -expressed on the can-\ncer cell surface [4] .

Consequently, eligibility of \nNET patients for PRRT should be discussed in an expert multidisciplinary team.

12G advanced RAG,Was sind die häufigsten Nebenwirkungen der PRRT?,german,general,side effects,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"Die häufigsten Nebenwirkungen der PRRT sind Müdigkeit, Übelkeit und Erbrechen.",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'infusion curve of the 30-min protocol, a fast infusion of PRRT\nhas probably no effect on renal toxicity. Furthermore, the occur-\nrence of clinically reported adverse events was comparable to the\nrates reported in previously published studies, and no speci ﬁc\ncomplaints were reported by any patient during the infusion of\nthe radiopharmaceutical ( 3,18). The NETTER-1 study reported\nsigniﬁcantly increased nausea and vomiting after PRRT com-\npared with standard SSA (somatostatin analog) treatment, with\nrates of 59% for nausea and 47% for vomiting. In the current\nstudy, nausea or vomiting occurred in 67.7% of patients (grade 1/2).

These adverse effects are often mild and temporary, with nausea and vomiting being the most frequently reported. Other possible side effects include myelosuppression, renal failure, and increased hair loss.",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'infusion curve of the 30-min protocol, a fast infusion of PRRT\nhas probably no effect on renal toxicity. Furthermore, the occur-\nrence of clinically reported adverse events was comparable to the\nrates reported in previously published studies, and no speci ﬁc\ncomplaints were reported by any patient during the infusion of\nthe radiopharmaceutical ( 3,18). The NETTER-1 study reported\nsigniﬁcantly increased nausea and vomiting after PRRT com-\npared with standard SSA (somatostatin analog) treatment, with\nrates of 59% for nausea and 47% for vomiting. In the current\nstudy, nausea or vomiting occurred in 67.7% of patients (grade 1/2). The most frequently encountered complaint in this study was\nthe occurrence of grade 1 or 2 fatigue, which is often preexistent,\nbut worsening during treatment.

P eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has gained momentum\nover the past two decades in patients who progress on SSAs. 177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the most widely used radiopeptide for\nPRRT. We reviewed the recent evidence on PRRT and the treatment of gastroentero-pancreatic neuroe ndocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).\nResults177Lu-DOTATATE can be used as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with inoperable GEP-NETs, who might be candidate\nfor surgery after treatment and as adjuvant therapy after surgical intervention. Combination treatments of PRRT with chemo-\ntherapy or targeted agents as well as combinations of radionuclides in patients with NETs have been explored over the last few\nyears. The majority of patients with NETs experience partial response or have disease stabilization, a small percentage has\ncomplete response, while some 30% of patients, however, will have disease progression. The safety and efficacy of retreatmentwith extra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy have been evaluated in small retrospective series.\nConclusion Overall, there is evidence that disease control and quality of life improve significantly after 117Lu PRRT therapy.\nClinical trials on this therapy are scarce, and there is a need for further studies to establish proper management guidelines.\nKeywords Nuclear medicine .Theranostics .Lutetium .Neuroendocrine tumors .Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy\nIntroduction to NETs and Current Lines\nof Treatment\nNeuroendocrine cells are distributed widely throughout the\nbody. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are epithelialneoplasms with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation,\ncan arise in most organs [ 1]. NETs are variable in their pre-\nsentation and are divided into functioning tumors and non-\nfunctioning tumors. Functioning tumors produce peptide oramines that can cause distinct clinical symptoms such asflushing, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, gastric ulcers, or skin rash.Nonfunctioning tumors on the other hand are more common\nand usually present with a large mass or bleeding, and are\nsomewhat difficult to differentiate from a classical cancer[2]. Even though clinical and pathologic features of these tu-\nmors are specific to the site of origin, some other characteris-tics are shared, regardless of site [ 1].\nIn the gastrointestinal system particularly, the most common\nmalignant NETs arise from the midgut (henceforth the focus ofthis paper). For patients presenting with metastatic disease, the\n5-year survival rate is less than 50% [ 3,4]. Their classification\nwas introduced by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor\nS o c i e t y( E N E T S )i n2 0 0 6a n d2 0 0 7[ 5,6], but an optimal cutoff\nvalue for the Ki-67 labeling index to distinguish differentgrades of gastroentero-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) has notbeen conclusively established. However, the ENETS,\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), and the 2010\nWHO classification include a K i-67 labeling cutoff of < 3% to\ndefine low-grade (G1), 3 –20% for intermediate-grade (G2), and\n> 20% for high-grade (G3) NETs (Table 1)[5,6].', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 11 of 17\nof patients treated with PRRT who had mesenteric and/or peritoneal metastases ranged\nfrom 6–51% [ 27,117,118]. In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved. Figure 1\ndemonstrates a representative case of PRRT in a neoadjuvant setting.']"

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'The evolution of PRRT for the\ntreatment of neuroendocrinetumors; What comes next?\nPhilip E. Harris *and Konstantin Zhernosekov\nITM Oncologics GmbH, Garching, Germany\nLu-177 has been developed for the treatment of patients with peptide receptor\nradionuclide therapy (PRRT). A second generation pure no-carrier-added Lu-\n177 has a high speci ﬁc activity and has waste disposal advantages over the ﬁrst\ngeneration carrier-added Lu-177. PRRT has recently been developed for the\ntreatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The majority of pancreatic and\ngastroenteric NETs (GEP-NETs) express the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) 2\nand 5. These receptors can be speci ﬁcally targeted with a somatostatin peptide\nanalogue (DOTATOC/DOTATATE) which can be chelated to a positron\nemission tomography (PET) emitting radioisotope such as Ga-68 for imaging\nor to a b-emitting radioisotope Lu-177 for therapy. A key advantage of this\napproach is that the receptor expression can be demonstrated by PET imaging\nbefore the patient is treated. Clinical studies in G1 and G2 GEP-NETS have\ndemonstrated that PRRT is extremely effective in terms of progression free\nsurvival (PFS), symptom control and quality of life, with a well-established safety\nproﬁle. A bene ﬁcial effect on outcome survival awaits to be con ﬁrmed. The ﬁrst\ncommercially available product Lu-177-DOTATATE was approved followingthe NETTER-1 trial in G1 and G2 GE-NETS. Lu-177-DOTATATE 7,4 GBq every 8\nweeks for 4 cycles, together with octreotide LAR 30 mg monthly,\ndemonstrated a median PFS of 28,4 months compared to 8,5 months for\noctreotide LAR 60 mg monthly. A second pivotal study COMPETE is currently in\nprogress, comparing no carrier-added (n.c.a.) Lu-177-DOTATOC to the m-\nTOR inhibitor Everolimus in both GE-NETs and PNETs. Two studies, NETTER-2\nand COMPOSE are currently underway in patients with high grade G2 and G3\nNETs. Novel SSTR antagonists are being developed as next generation targeting\nmolecules for SSTR2-expressing tumors. Antagonists have a higher tumor\nbinding to receptors than agonists, opening up the potential indications for\nSSTR2 targeting to tumors which have a relatively lower expression of SSTR2\ncompared to NET such as small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and\nbreast cancer. In addition to Lu-177, radioisotopes with different radiation\nproperties such as Tb-161 and the a-emitter Ac-225 are being developed\nwhich have the potential to improve treatment ef ﬁcacy across the range of G1\nto G3 NETs.\nKEYWORDS\npeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT),\nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs), Lutetium-177, Ga-68 PET, dosimetry\nFrontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin.org 01\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nElcin Zan,\nNew York University, United States\nREVIEWED BY\nCarsten Grötzinger,\nCharite ´Universitätsmedizin Berlin,\nGermany\nAlan Harris,\nNew York University, United States\nRoberta Modica,\nUniversity of Naples Federico II, Italy\nRaj Srirajaskanthan,\nKing ’s College London,\nUnited Kingdom\n*CORRESPONDENCE\nPhilip E.

Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs. However, PRRT has not been directly compared to any other\nestablished regimen. PRRT outperformed SSA, everolimus, sunitinib, everolimus + SSA ,\nand everolimus + bevacizumab in terms of PFS.

Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Antiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting.

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs).

PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients.

Nicolas1, Alfred Morgenstern2, Margret Schottelius3, and Melpomeni Fani4\n1Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland;2Joint Research Centre,\nDirectorate for Nuclear Safety and Security, European Commission, Karlsruhe, Germany;3Institute of Pharmaceutical\nRadiochemistry, Technische Universit¨ at M¨ unchen, Garching, Germany; and4Division of Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry, University\nHospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established\ntreatment for nonoperable or metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms\nthat highly and frequently express somatostatin receptors. More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).']"

INTRODUCTION (background) \nApplications for marketing authorisation in resp ect of radiopharmaceuticals should be accompanied, as \nin the case of all medicinal products, by the part iculars and documents referred to in Directive \n2001/83/EC, as amended. This guideline provides information about specific requirements for \nradiopharmaceuticals. The relevant  provisions of the current Eur opean Pharmacopoeia should be \nobserved. Due account must be taken of releva nt CHMP guidelines which should be applied with \nspecial interpretation, recommendation or completion for radiopharmaceuticals, as discussed in this \nguideline. Radiopharmaceuticals are exempted from a number of guidelines, but with special interpretation they could still give the necessary guidance on the matter.  \nRadiopharmaceuticals are used for diagnostic and th erapeutic purposes. They are usually given only \nonce, or sometimes on a few occasions, and contain only small amounts of the active substances with a \nradionuclide attached to them to allow scintigra phic imaging, measurement of biodistribution or \ntherapeutic treatment. Such radiopharmaceuticals do often not show any measurable pharmacodynamic \neffect.  Radiation is a general property of all radi opharmaceuticals, which when administered gives the \npatient an inevitable radiation dose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect \nis the wanted property. \nRadiopharmaceuticals have decreasing content of radioactivity with time, as a consequence of the \nradioactive decay.  The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often shor t for radiopharmaceutical \ndiagnostics. In these cases, the final preparation has to be done shortly before administration to the patient. This is in particular the case for positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals for Tomography (PET \nradiopharmaceuticals). It often leads to the use of  semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide \ngenerators, radioactive precursors and kits.  \n2. SCOPE \nThis guideline covers the following products: \n- ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals, including PET radiopharmaceuticals;  \n- non-radioactive components (kits and chemical precursors including those for positron \nemission Tomography) for combination with a radioactive component (e.g. eluate from a \nradionuclide generator or a cyclotron produced radionuclide);  \n- radionuclide generators; \n- radionuclide precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration.  \nArticle 3.5 of Directive 2001/83/EC specifically mentions radionuclides in sealed sources as being \noutside the requirements of the Directive, and therefore outside the scope of this guideline. \nConcerning radiopharmaceuticals based monoclonal antibodies, a separate guideline exists (3AQ21a). \nConcerning radiopharmaceuticals intended in the conduct of clinical trials (investigational medicinal \nproducts), the principles of this guideline expressed  in eudralex vol 10 have to be applied.  \nEMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007   Page 3/10', ""Concept paper on the revision of the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals    \nEMA/CHMP/QWP/298182/2023   Page 2/5 \n 1.  Introduction 14 \nThe time elapsed since its adoption and the growing experience gained during the last years 15 \nhas lead to the identification of the need to update the current Guideline on 16 \nradiopharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007).  17 \n2.  Problem sta tement  18 \nRadiopharmaceuticals are a special type of medicinal products that were the subject of a 19 \nspecific guideline covering their particular requirements very early after their inclusion in the 20 \nPharmaceutical legislation framework by Council Directive 89/343/EEC. A few guidelines 21 \nexplicitly exclude radiopharmaceuticals from their scope; nevertheless, the 22 \ngrounds/principles of these guidelines can, in some cases, be a useful guide also for 23 \nradiopharmaceuticals. Those guidelines not excluding radiopharmaceuti cals are, in principle, 24 \napplicable, althou gh in many cases will require appropriate interpretation.  25 \nThe particularities of radiopharmaceuticals derive mainly from the fact that, when ready for 26 \nadministration to the patient, they contain one or more radionu clides, that the strength is 27 \nexpressed in terms of the radioactivity (radioactivity concentration for liquid dosage forms or 28 \ntotal radioactivity per dosage unit in some cases), the posology is expressed in terms of the 29 \namount of radioactivity administered to the patient and not in terms of mass (o r amount of 30 \nsubstance) and finally, that the amount of radioactivity decreases with time. This has led to 31 \nthe need of defining, along with 'radiopharmaceutical', three additional specific types of 32 \nmedicinal product s: radionuclide generator, radionuclide precursor and kit (for 33 \nradiopharmaceutical preparation).  34 \nThe current Guideline on radiopharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007) is a quality 35 \nguideline adopted in 2008 as an update of the original guideline dated b ack in 1990. The 36 \nexperience gained during the assessment of the (growing) number Marketing Authorisation 37 \nApplications (MAA), Variations and Clinical Trials dealing with radiopharmaceuticals, shows 38 \nthat the revision that lead to the current guideline was pa rticularly necessary and has 39 \ndemonstrated to be very useful. Nevertheless, the same experience made it clear that non 40 \nharmonised interpretations, lack of coverage of some issues and poorly detailed treatment of 41 \nsome others requires a new update to cope wit h these problems and to deal with recent 42 \ndevelopments and practices in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, Ph.Eur. texts on 43 \nradiopharmaceuticals have been the subject of significant changes since the adoption of the 44 \ncurrent guideline.  45 \nThe revision  of the current guideline has to be done m aintaining the alignment with the 46 \nprovisions on radiopharmaceuticals of the current Community code relating to medicinal 47 \nproducts for human use (Directive 2001/83/EC), with the current texts of the Ph.Eur. on 48 \nradiopharmaceuticals and with other relevant le gal and regulatory framework.  49 \nThe guideline is not intended to cover the in -house preparation of non -licensed 50 \nradiopharmaceuticals.  51 \nAccording to the BWP work plan for 2023, the guideline 3AQ21a 'Radiopharmaceuticals 52 \nbased on Monoclonal Antibodies' is being updated in parallel.  53 \n3.

The success of iodide-131 in targeting and \ntreating thyroid disorders and carcinomas encouraged \nthe expansion of its use in a variety of cancers through \nits incorporation into targeting vectors. For example, iobenguane I-131 is the radioiodinated small- molecule \nmeta - iodobenzylguanidine ([\n131I]mIBG), an analogue of  \nthe adrenergic neutrotransmitter noradrenaline that \nis used to treat patients with neuroblastomas140– 142. \nIodide-131 can be introduced to targeting vectors as a highly reactive electrophilic iodine compound, allowing \nrapid iodination of molecules containing activated aro-matic groups, or through displacement by nucleophilic attack of the radioiodide\n143. mIBG radiolabelled with \nhigh- specific- activity iodine-131 was recently approved \nby the FDA for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 12 years or older with unresectable meta-static phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma. No FDA-  \napproved therapy was available for these conditions \nbefore approval of this agent. Use of this agent requires \na positive mIBG imaging scan, standard, weight- based \ntherapeutic dosing and the application of a process for individualized dosimetry using a pretreatment tracer \nstudy to calculate absorbed doses for normal organs. \nNormal organ dosimetry is used to adjust the activity administered so that the organ doses are below speci-fied threshold levels. FDA approval of this agent was \nbased on the substantial pre- existing experience with \n[\n131I]mIBG144– 151 and on a recent phase I study which \nyielded 1-  year and 2-  year overall survival of 85.7% and \n61.9%, respectively, in 21 patients treated with the maxi-\nmum tolerated dose152. Clinical trials using this agent are \nongoing (NCT03561259 and NCT02378428).\nPSMA and folate receptor ligands. The past decade has \nseen increasing use of small- molecule radiotherapeutics \ntargeting receptors such as PSMA receptor and folate \nreceptor (FR). Small- molecule PSMA inhibitors have \nbeen modified to deliver radiotherapeutic nuclides in \nprostate cancer as well as other cancers owing to the expression of PSMA on the neovasculature of tumours. \nPSMA inhibitors are designed to mimic its substrates, \nγ- glutamyl folic acid derivatives and the neuropeptide \nN- acetylaspartylglutamate\n153,154. These small- molecule \nRPT agents are either urea- based inhibitors (for \nexample, 177Lu- labelled PSMA- R2 and 177Lu- labelled  \nPSMA-617)155– 162 or phosphoramidate- based inhibitors \n(for example, 177Lu- labelled CTT-1403) modified to \ndeliver therapeutic radionuclides163– 165. The urea and \nphosphoramidate functionalities interact with zinc(ii) \nlocated in the PSMA active site; in addition, these small \nmolecules are designed to interact with the S1 glutamate pocket as well as the entrance funnel of PSMA \n(fIG.4a,b) . \nThe entrance funnel allows a wide variation of modi -\nfications to present a pendant group or a chelator for radiolabelling with therapeutic and imaging radio-nuclides.

The simultaneous emission of imageable gamma photons [208 keV (11%) and \n113 keV (6.4%)] along with particulate \x02- emission [ \x02(max) = 497 keV] makes it a theranostically desir-\nable radioisotope. In the present article, the possibility of using two 177Lu-based agents viz. 177Lu-\nEDTMP and 177Lu-DOTA-TATE for theranostic applications in metastatic bone pain palliation \n(MBPP) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), have been explored. In the case of 177Lu-\nEDTMP, the whole-body images obtained are compared with those recorded using 99mTc-MDP in the \nsame patient. On the other hand, pre-therapy images acquired with 177Lu-DOTA-TATE are compared with similar images \nobtained with standard agents, such as 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC (SPECT) and 68Ga-DOTA-TOC (PET) in the same patient. \nThe advantage of the long physical half-life (T 1/2) of 177Lu has been utilized in mapping the pharmacokinetics of two addi-\ntional agents, 177Lu-labeled hydroxyapatite (HA) in radiation synovectomy of knee joints and 177Lu-HA for therapy of he-\npatocellular carcinoma. Results of these multiple studies conclusively documen t the potential of 177Lu as a theranostic ra-\ndioisotope. \nKeywords: 177Lu, Theranostic applications, Metastatic bone pain palliation, Peptide receptor radi onuclide therapy, \nPharmacokinetic mapping.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe term ‘Theranostics’ was first used by John Funk-\nhouser in 2002 while describing his company’s business \nmodel in developing diagnostic tests directly linked to the \napplication of specific therapies [1]. ‘Theranostic’ refers to a \ncombination of two interdependent applications namely ther-\napy and diagnosis, using the same agent [2]. Since both di-\nagnosis and therapy can be effected using this concept of \ntheranosis, the treatment regime can be individualized for \nplanning a specific dose for a specific patient [3]. This pos-\nsibility forms the basis of ‘personalized medicine’ wherein \nthe appropriate dose of a drug can be administered with re-\nspect to safety and efficacy [3, 4]. Since both diagnostic and \ntherapeutic radionuclides are used in radiopharmaceutical \npreparation, the concept of, ‘theranosis’ is particularly rele-\nvant in nuclear medicine practices. In actual practice, ther-\nanosis can be effected by replacing a diagnostic radioisotope \nin a radiopharmaceutical with a therapeutic radioisotope usu-\nally with same chemical properties ( i.e. 188Re for 99mTc), \nwhile using the same molecular vector, thereby not compro-\nmising the biological avidity of the radiopharmaceuticals [5]. \nTheranosis helps in augmenting a diagnostic dose to a thera-\npeutic one in order to tailor the therapy in a specific patient. \nIn this modality, necessary pre-therapy information of bio-\npharmacokinetics and dosimetry can be utilized to personal-\nize the therapeutic regime [5]. \nWhile making use of theranosis, there are three distinct \npossibilities.', '100\nAkgün, Özgenç, GündoğduIt can be used in diagnosis and therapy. Also, Indi-\num-111 (In-111) Octreotide therapy and, In-111 Oc-\ntreotide scintigraphy, I-131 MIBG therapy and I-131 \nMIBG scintigraphy, Lu-177 DOTA therapy, and Lu-\n177 DOTA scintigraphy are examples of this group \n(Durak, 2015; Srivastava, 2012).\nSimilar Diagnostic and Therapeutic Molecules \nExamples for this group are imaging with Tech-\nnetium-99m (Tc-99m)-MDP or Tc-99m-HDP , treat-\nment with Re-186-HEDP , or Sm-153-EDTMP , and imaging with Ga-68-DOTA and treatment with Lu-177 or Y-90 DOTA peptides (Srivastava, 2012).\nDue to the different electron configurations of \nradionuclides, chemical and biochemical features, molecular stability, and biological behavior of radio-\npharmaceuticals can differ, but similar behavior is ex-\npected for these molecules (Durak, 2015).\nDifferent Diagnostic and Therapeutic Molecules, \nBut Similar Effect Mechanism \nThe treatment with the Y-90 microsphere, imag-\ning with Tc-99m MAA in liver cancer, can be given as the most common sample of this group. Although the \nmolecules are entirely different from each other, the \nbehavior is similar (Durak, 2015).\nCONCLUSION\nThe selection of suitable radionuclides is essential \nin any therapeutic radiopharmaceutical development. \nTheir nuclear emission characteristics, physical half-life, \ndegradation properties effect in vivo pharmacokinet -\nics, cost, and availability of the radiopharmaceuticals. Also, types of particle emission affect the distribution \nand pharmacokinetics of the radiopharmaceuticals. For \ntherapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, radionuclides that degrade by α-particle, B-particle, and Auger-electron \nemission are commonly used in the preparation.\nIn this review article, information about the radio\n-\npharmaceuticals used in the treatment is given. Today, \na limited number of radiopharmaceuticals are routine -\nly used in the treatment of many diseases. In the past ten years, clinical studies have been focused on radio\n-\nimmunotherapy. Studies on radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies and radiolabeled receptor binding agents \nare being conducted. Few studies have achieved their goal so far and are currently used in treatment. The best results have been achieved in treating lymphomas, and two FDA-approved radiopharmaceuticals are used in practice. Radiopharmaceutical science is an emerging research field that meets the clinical standards. They have an essential therapy index and high imaging abil\n-\nity. The scientific community examines various radio -\nnuclides, pharmaceutical agents, radiopharmaceuticals, and evaluating in vivo performance of newly developed radiopharmacauticals. Thus, great efforts are being made to develop new radiopharmaceuticals to be con\n-\nverted into clinical research to treat many diseases. As detailed in this review, most of the current studies focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of radio\n-\npharmaceuticals. We believe that these developments will have positively affects on human life and lead to positive results in the diagnosis and therapy of patients.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of \ninterest.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTION STATEMENTDeveloping hypothesis (Gundogdu E.)  prepar -\ning the study text (Akgun E., Ozgenc E.) reviewing \nthe text (Gundogdu E., Ozgenc E.) literature research (Akgun E., Ozgenc E.)\nREFERENCES\nAdalet, A.

Theranostic ligands are used to image disease or selectively deliver cytotoxic radioactivity to \ncells expressing PSMA according to the radioisotope conjugated to the ligand. PSMA theranostics is a rapidly \nadvancing field that is now integrating into clinical management of prostate cancer patients. In this review we \nsummarize published research describing the biological role(s) and activity of PSMA, highlight the most clini-\ncally advanced PSMA targeting molecules and biomacromolecules, and identify next generation PSMA ligands \nthat aim to further improve treatment efficacy. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment \nof the current state-of-play and a roadmap to achieving further advances in PSMA theranostics.   \nIntroduction \nProstate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly and selectively \nexpressed on prostate cancer cells. Consequently, there is significant \ninterest in ligands that bind PSMA as a means of visualizing and treating \nthese cancers. Despite the interest in PSMA, its functions in normal or \nneoplastic prostate cells are poorly understood. Understanding the \nbiology of this protein may inform efforts to better target PSMA and the \nassociated cancers, just as the use of PSMA ligands has already indicated \nnew aspects of prostate cancers and its treatment. Here, we provide a \nbrief review of the biology of PSMA, as well as an overview of ongoing \nefforts to develop PSMA ligands as theranostic (diagnostic +therapeu -\ntic) agents. \nPart 1: the biology and biochemistry of PSMA \nPSMA: gene and proteins \nPSMA is known by several names - glutamate carboxypeptidase II \n(GCPII), N-acetylated- α-linked acidic dipeptidase [1,2], and folate hy-\ndrolase (FOLH1) [3,4] - which reflect the activities of this enzyme in different tissues. These proteins are actively transcribed from one of two \ncopies of the FOLH1 gene. The relevant gene is situated at position 11.12 \non the p arm of chromosome 11 (GenBank: AF007544) [5,6], while a \npseudogene is located on the other arm at position 11.14 [7]. A total of \n19 exons and 18 introns [5,6] comprise the gene, which also contains \nmultiple start sites that give rise to distinct products at different sites [2, \n8–13]. Of these products, PSMA and FOLH1 are 100% homologous [10] \nwhile PSMA/FOLH1 and GCPII are 83% homologous [14–16]. Normal \nprostate cells express an FOLH1 transcript that encodes a cytoplasmic \nprotein of unknown function [9,11,17,18].

Its appealing\nmolecular features have enabled the development of a novel diagnostic and therapeutic—thus\n“theranostic”—approach to PCa. There is now substantial evidence of the high sensitivity of\nPSMA-targeted imaging for PCa lesions and growing evidence of the therapeutic e ﬃcacy of PSMA\nradioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This article presents a broad\noverview of the current status of PSMA theranostics, including current evidence, potential clinical\nimpact, and active areas of research.\nKeywords: prostate speciﬁc membrane antigen; theranostics; prostate cancer\n1. Introduction\nAlso known as folate hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, prostate-speciﬁc membrane\nantigen (PSMA) is a type II, 750 amino acid transmembrane protein. In benign prostatic cells, it is\nlocalized to the cytoplasmic and apical side of the prostate epithelium. As malignant transformation\noccurs, PSMA is transferred from the cytoplasm to the luminal surface of the prostatic ducts, where\nit presents a large extracellular domain to ligands [ 1]. The biological function of PSMA remains\nunclear, but it is hypothesized to have a transport function because PSMA ligands are internalized\nthrough endocytosis.\nPSMA ligand internalization theoretically enables speciﬁcity of synthetic PSMA radioligands\nfor malignant prostatic tissue. Furthermore, research suggests a 100- to 1000-fold increase in PSMA\nexpression in prostatic adenocarcinoma vs. benign prostatic tissue [ 2,3]. Although there is an increasing\nunderstanding of inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of expression, PSMA expression generally\nincreases with tumor dedi ﬀerentiation and in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\nNeuroendocrine PCa may be an exception to this rule, as case reports suggest that the PSMA gene\n(FOLH1 ) may be suppressed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (PCa) [4].\nDespite its name, PSMA is expressed in various benign and neoplastic tissues. Histopathological\nstudies have conﬁrmed PSMA expression in salivary glands, duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubular\ncells, and neuroendocrine cells in the colonic crypts [ 5]. However, PSMA expression is substantially\nlower in these tissues than in PCa lesions [ 6,7]. Studies have observed PSMA radiotracer uptake in\nvarious non-prostatic tissues. High uptake of the novel PSMA radiotracer64copper (64Cu)-PSMA has\nbeen observed in salivary glands, kidneys, and the liver [ 8].']"

Although the past two decades witnessed both an increased incidence and \nprevalence of NEN along with a significant improvement in their management, many issues \nremain openly debated.1,2\nNET share many diagnostic commonalities, since they are often hypervascular and > \n80% over-express somatostatin receptor (SSTR) on their surface.3 This allows the use of \nSSTR imaging for staging of these tumours. Moreover, SSTR-imaging can help select \npatients for specific therapies targeting SSTR. Surgery, when feasible, is the mainstay of \ntherapy for patients with non-metastatic NET, or those who are candidates for cytoreductive \noperations. Long-acting somatostatin analogues (SSA) including octreotide and lanreotide \nare first line medical therapy for most patients with advanced NETs. Second line treatments \nfor NET, depending on the primary tumour site, include molecularly targeted therapies \nsuch as everolimus and sunitinib, chemotherapy, interferon-alpha, locoregional treatments \nincluding transarterial (chemo)embolization, selective internal radiation therapy, and peptide \nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).4 PRRT, available since the early 1990s, has proved \nto be a major advance in the therapeutic management of NET based on accurate patient \nselection through SSTR imaging leading to a long median progression-free survival \n(PFS).5,6 However, the results obtained with PRRT in early clinical trials were difficult \nto translate into clinical routine, because they applied different PRRT protocols in terms of \ninjected dose, treatment schedule, and radiopharmaceutical preparations. Patients were often \noffered PRRT in advanced disease stages after progression on other lines of treatment.4 A \nrandomized phase III trial on standard dose PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE in patients with \nmidgut NET recently led to its approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and \nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA).7 Although the NETTER-1 study included only \npatients with mid-gut tumours, the subsequent FDA/EMA approval was extended to include \npancreatic NET.\nBecause some NET centres routinely use the most advanced diagnostic (eg, [68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA PET/CT) and therapeutic (eg, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE PRRT) options, and \nother centres have only recently implemented these techniques, there are differences in the \nclinical management of NET patients across countries. Many consensus expert panels such \nas the European Association for Nuclear Medicine (EANM), the European Neuroendocrine \nTumour Society (ENETS), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the \nNorth American Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (NANETS) have published guidelines \nconcerning molecular imaging and theranostics in NEN.4,8–16,17(p) However, the rarity and \nheterogeneous presentation of NEN, coupled with the different pace of availability of several \nprocedures (mainly PET/CT with SSTR and PRRT) across countries strongly influenced \nthe proposed diagnostic and therapeutic flow-charts and, therefore, the routine local \nmanagement of NEN patients and the consequent growth of local expertise.18 Therefore, \nif on one side these efforts led to an increased detection, awareness and recognition of NEN \nand to a significant improvement in their management, on the other side many issues still \nremain openly debated.Ambrosini et al.

Initial efficacy results were based on very high doses of \n111In-DTPA0-octreotide,11 but \nmore promising results were subsequently found with \n90Y-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC)17 \nand with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotate (177Lu-\nDotatate).12 Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a beta- and \ngamma-emitting radionuclide with a maximum particle range of 2 mm and a half-life of 160 hours.\n18 In a single-group trial of 177Lu-Dotatate \ninvolving 310 patients who had gastroenteropan -\ncreatic neuroendocrine tumors, complete tumor remissions occurred in 2% of the patients and partial tumor remissions in 28%.\n12 The median \nprogression-free survival was 33 months.\nWe report here results from the phase 3 Neuro -\nendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of \n177Lu-\nDotatate as compared with high-dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) in patients with advanced, progressive, somatostatin-receptor–positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis international, multicenter, phase 3 trial was conducted at 41 centers in 8 countries world -wide. Eligible patients were adults who had mid -\ngut neuroendocrine tumors that had metastasized or were locally advanced, that were inoperable, that were histologically confirmed and centrally verified, and that showed disease progression (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1\n19) on either \ncomputed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso -\nnance imaging (MRI) over the course of a maxi -\nmum period of 3 years during treatment with octreotide LAR (20 to 30 mg every 3 to 4 weeks for at least 12 weeks before randomization).

Well-differentiated histologic features were defined as a Ki67 index (the percentage of cells that are positive for Ki67 as determined by immunos -\ntaining of the primary tumor) of 20% or less; tumors were assessed as low-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 0 to 2%, intermediate-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 3 to 20%, or high-grade if they had a Ki67 index of greater than 20%, with a lower grade indicating a lower rate of prolifera -\ntive activity.', 'The new england journal of medicinen engl j med 376;2  nejm.org  January 12, 2017 125The authors’ full names, academic de -\ngrees, and affiliations are listed in the \nA\nppendix.

The ability of somatostatin analogs to control the growth ofwell-differentiated metastatic NETs is a matter of debate. We performed a placebo-controlled,double-blind, phase IIIB study in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs. Thehypothesis was that octreotide LAR prolongs time to tumor progression and survival.\nPatients and Methods\nTreatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or octreotide LAR 30 mg\nintramuscularly in monthly intervals until tumor progression or death. The primary efﬁcacy endpoint was time to tumor progression. Secondary end points were survival time and tumorresponse. This report is based on 67 tumor progressions and 16 observed deaths in 85 patientsat the time of the planned interim analysis.\nResults\nMedian time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6\nmonths, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] /H110050.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P/H11005.000072). After 6 months\nof treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and37.2% of patients in the placebo group. Functionally active and inactive tumors respondedsimilarly. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load andresected primary tumor. Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebogroups, respectively. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18).']"

21E advanced RAG,What is the control arm in the Netter-2 trial?,english,specific,study,command-r-plus advanced RAG,High-dose somatostatin analogs (SSAs),,,,"['7,10The ongoing COMPETE trial is currently looking\nat this very question in GEPNETs, with one group beingrandomized to\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT and the other to\neverolimus.16For patients with pancreatic NETs, there are\nmore choices available, which include PRRT, sunitinib,everolimus, and capecitabine/temozolomide, which may\nhelp explain why over three quarters of patients initially\nreceived TT/CT instead of PRRT in this study. Greateruncertainty remains in patients with higher-grade tumors,\nwho did not appear to derive as much beneﬁt from PRRT.\nThe ongoing NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488), which israndomizing patients with higher-grade GEPNETs (well-\ndifferentiated, grade 2 and 3 with Ki-67 10–55%) to PRRT\n(with 30 mg Sandostatin LAR, q 4 weeks) vs high-doseSSAs, will help determine the efﬁcacy of PRRT in these\npatients. If a PFS beneﬁt is found in NETTER-2, the\nquestion of whether this is superior to TT or CT willremain, especially for patients with PNETs. That question\nmay be answered by the COMPOSE trial, comparing\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT to best standard of care (including\nall TT and CT) in aggressive grade 2 and grade 3 GEP-\nNETs.16Another relevant trial just opening is Alliance for\nClinical Trials in Oncology A022001 (ComPareNET;NCT05247905), which will randomize patients with pro-\ngressive, advanced, well-differentiated grade 1–3\npancreatic NETs to PRRT (\n177Lu-DOTATATE x 4 cycles)\nor 12 cycles of capecitabine/temozolomide.\nPusceddu et al. have given us valuable understanding of\ntreatment patterns of patients with progressive pancreatic\nand intestinal NETs in Italy, and how PRRT may improve\nPFS in many patients. However, it also suffers from thesame issues dogging all non-randomized studies in NETs.\nFirst is the concern with selection bias, which these authors\naddressed by propensity-matching. Second is the fact thatpatients usually live long enough to cross over to the other\ntherapeutic arm. Since overall survival was not affected in\nthis study, how can we be sure that giving PRRT before orafter TT/CT is better for patients? We do know that PRRT\nwith\n177Lu-DOTATATE is fairly safe, with low incidence\nof nephrotoxicity, a 2% rate of myelodysplastic syndromeor leukemia, and only 6% of patients having grade 3 or 4\nadverse events.\n8Grade 3 or 4 adverse events leading to\ntreatment discontinuation occurred in 12% of patientsreceiving everolimus in RADIANT-4,\n10and even more\ngrade 3 or 4 adverse events were seen in pancreatic NET\npatients treated with sunitinib.11Time to deterioration of\nquality of life may be another important measure to be\nconsidered when choosing the next therapy on progression.\nThis duration was signiﬁcantly longer in the177Lu-\nDOTATATE group in NETTER-1.15Although the results\nof the current study would seem to favor PRRT as the next6502 J.

24G advanced RAG,"Ist es möglich die verschiedenen Guidelines zu Management von neuroendokrinen Tumoren vergleichend darzustellen (ENETS, NANETS)? Wo sind hier die Unterschiede in der Therapie dieser Erkrankung? ",german,specific,guidelines,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"Ich kann die ENETS- und NANETS-Richtlinien für das Management neuroendokriner Tumoren vergleichen und die Unterschiede in der Therapie hervorheben.

Die ENETS-Richtlinien (Pavel et al., 2016) empfehlen für Patienten mit Lebermetastasen ohne extrahepatische Erkrankung einen interdisziplinären Ansatz, einschließlich Chirurgie, Morphologie und funktioneller Bildgebung. Die Behandlungsmöglichkeiten umfassen Leberresektion, Transplantation, Ablation und verschiedene systemische Therapien wie Somatostatin-Analoga (SSA), Chemotherapie und zielgerichtete Therapien.

Im Gegensatz dazu betonen die NANETS-Richtlinien (nicht im Kontext angegeben, aber auf externen Quellen basierend) die Bedeutung der Krankheitsstadien und der Tumorbiologie bei der Behandlung. NANETS empfiehlt für Patienten mit gut differenzierten Tumoren (G1 und G2) eine kurative Behandlung, einschließlich Chirurgie und lokaler Behandlungen wie Ablation. Für Patienten mit metastasierten Erkrankungen oder aggressiveren Tumoren (G3) werden systemische Behandlungen wie SSA, Chemotherapie und zielgerichtete Therapien in Betracht gezogen.

Die Hauptunterschiede zwischen ENETS und NANETS liegen in der Gewichtung verschiedener Behandlungsoptionen und dem Zeitpunkt ihres Einsatzes. Während ENETS einen umfassenderen Ansatz verfolgt und verschiedene Behandlungen kombiniert, legt NANETS den Schwerpunkt auf die Krankheitsstadien und die Tumorbiologie, um die Behandlung zu lenken. Darüber hinaus können sich die Empfehlungen für bestimmte Behandlungen, wie z. B. die Verwendung von SSA, je nach den spezifischen Kriterien jeder Richtlinie unterscheiden.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass sowohl ENETS als auch NANETS einen individualisierten Ansatz für das Management neuroendokriner Tumoren empfehlen, wobei die Behandlung auf die spezifischen Merkmale jedes Patienten abgestimmt wird. Die Wahl der Behandlung hängt von einer Reihe von Faktoren ab, darunter der Krankheitsstadium, die Tumorbiologie, die Symptome und der allgemeine Gesundheitszustand des Patienten.

This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  . These well-construct-\ned phase III trials in NET have an impact on the current treatment recommendations and therapeutic algorithm. In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status. Variation of treatment choices will also depend on physician exper-tise, the complexity of the treatment center and access to novel treatments. Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control. In some patients, it may be necessary to combine therapies for example to suppress symptoms using SSA in addition to locoregion-al therapies or other antiproliferative agents. \n  Locoregional Therapies \n In the absence of any large comparative trials of dif-\nferent locoregional or ablative therapies (bland embo-lization, chemoembolization, radioembolization, radio-frequency ablation or microwave destruction) or system-ic treatment, the choice of treatment is based on individual patient features (e.g. size, distribution and  Table 1.

This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC).

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status. Variation of treatment choices will also depend on physician exper-tise, the complexity of the treatment center and access to novel treatments. Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control. In some patients, it may be necessary to combine therapies for example to suppress symptoms using SSA in addition to locoregion-al therapies or other antiproliferative agents. \n  Locoregional Therapies \n In the absence of any large comparative trials of dif-\nferent locoregional or ablative therapies (bland embo-lization, chemoembolization, radioembolization, radio-frequency ablation or microwave destruction) or system-ic treatment, the choice of treatment is based on individual patient features (e.g. size, distribution and  Table 1.

In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

The main organs of concern\nare the bone marrow and the kidney. Transient hematotoxicity,\nparticularly thrombocytopenia, is frequently seen usually around\n4-6 weeks after a treatment cycle but this usually rapidly\nrecovers, allowing a following cycle of treatment. Long-term\nmyelodysplasia or leukaemia appears to occur in a little over 2%\nof patients, although historically, many have been heavily pre-\ntreated. Renal toxicity, which is mitigated with concomitant\namino acid infusion ( 20) has been mainly related to Y-90\ntherapy and is uncommon with Lu-177 ( 28,29).\nThe diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with\nGEP-NETs is detailed in recent ESMO Guidelines ( 3). PRRT has\nbeen shown to be ben ﬁcial in the management of patients with\nsymptoms of carcinoid syndrome ( 30). ESMO Guidelines\nrecommend the use of Lu-177-DOTATATE following\nsomatostatin analogue therapy, for the treatment of patients\nwith carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and/or ﬂushing. PRRT is also\nrecommended for patients with GE NETs who have progressive\ndisease following treatment with somatostatin analogues or with\neverolimus and for PNETs following treatment with everolimus,\nsunitinib or chemotherapy (capecitabine and temozolomide/\nstreptozotocin and 5- ﬂuorouracil).\nAlthough PRRT for the treatment of patients with NETs has\nprovided a new paradigm for the management of patients with\nadvanced metastatic disease, the optimal treatment regimen and\nalso the positioning of PRRT in the treatment algorithm remain\nto be de ﬁned. At the present time, patients received a standard\nactivity/dose of treatment at ﬁxed intervals of 8 weeks\n(Lutathera) or 12 weeks (COMPETE study). The currenttreatment regimens are based on empirical observations in the\nclinic. Opportunities for further improving the management of\npatients are expected with new antagonist targeting molecules\nand the application of radionuclides which with different\nphysicochemical properties to Lu-177. A number of clinical\ntrials with PRRT in NETs are currently ongoing ( Table 3 ).The future of targeted radiotherapy in\nNETS\nAt the present time, patients receive a standardized\ntreatment regimen of ~7,5GBq 8-12 weekly for 4 cycles. There\nis a great deal of interest in individualizing patients ’therapy\nregimens based on dosimetry. All patients in the COMPETE\nstudy undergo dosimetric evaluation with 2D planar imaging at\n0,5 hrs, 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 72-96 hrs after the ﬁrst infusion and\nSPECT/CT for hybrid 2D/3D dosimetry at 24 hrs post each\ninfusion. Sub-study A will compare the cumulative absorbed\ndoses to kidneys and target lesions extrapolated from dose 1 to\nthe cumulative absorbed dose from all 4 infusions. In sub-study\nB, the absorbed dose estimated by 3D dosimetry will be\ncompared to estimates from planar 2D and hybrid 2D/3D\ndosimetry. It is expected that the dosimetry data from these\nstudies will facilitate the a pplication of dosimetry to\nindividualized therapy, rather than the standard ‘one size ﬁts\nall’approach.\nThe currently available data for PRRT of NET patients are\nmainly for those with advanced disease, who have receivedprevious therapies. These patients inevitably relapse at some\nstage. Earlier positioning in the treatment algorithm is of\nparticular interest and data for the ﬁrst-line therapy will be\nforthcoming from COMPETE ,C O M P O S Ea n dN E T T E R - 2\ntrials. Neoadjuvant therapy in PNETs is a subject of interest\nwith anectodal reports of bene ﬁcial surgical outcomes in some\npatients ( 31).\nIt is apparent from dosimetry and safety that many patients\nare able to receive and bene ﬁt from additional cycles of\ntreatment ( 32,33).', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']"

The difference of 11.7 months on OS was not statistically\nsigniﬁcant, probably due to a high rate (36%) of cross-over of patients in the control arm to\nPRRT after progression [75].\nBased on the results of the NETTER-1 study, treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE\nwas approved by the Food and Drug Administration, by European Medicines Agency\nin 2017–2018 and has rapidly been incorporated on the most relevant clinical guide-\nlines [76–82] . Guidelines consider the most important inclusion criteria: inoperable/\nmetastatic well-differentiated (G1/G2) NET, sufﬁcient tumor uptake on the diagnostic\nSSTR functional images, creatinine clearance >50 mL/min, sufﬁcient bone marrow reserves,\nKarnofsky performance status >50 and expected survival >3 months. The most recent\nguidelines, those of ESMO published in 2020 [ 82], agree that PRRT-Lu can be recommended\nin patients with midgut metastatic NETs with disease progression on SSAs who fulﬁl the\ngeneral requirements. PRRT-Lu can also be considered at further therapy lines and in NETs\nfrom other sites than the midgut. Results from randomized clinical trials in pancreatic NETs\nare lacking; therefore, in pancreatic NETs, molecular targeted agents such as everolimus\nor sunitinib, and systemic chemotherapy may be prior treatment choices, and PRRT-Lu\nshould be considered after failure of these therapies.\n6. Future Use of Alfa-Emmitters Binded to Somatostatin Antagonists\nThe use of alpha emitting radionuclides in PRRT could potentially increase the level\nof tumoral cell death by increasing the number of DNA double-strand breaks. Alpha\nradiations can easily be shielded, however, they transmit lots of energy with a great\npenetrating power, and in this way they could be used for treatment. These radionuclides\ninclude 212Lead-212 (212Pb), 213Bismuth (213Bi) and 225Actinium (225Ac). Promising\nresults with 213Bi have been published in which enduring responses were observed in all\ntreated patients with moderate kidney toxicity and with even less acute hematotoxicity\nthan with the preceding beta therapies. Recently, a phase 1 study has been completed\nand results are pending. [212Pb]Pb-DOTAM-TATE has been tested. The primary objective\nwas to assess the dose limiting toxicity using ascending doses of this radionuclide. The\nsecondary objectives were to determine preliminary efﬁcacy as well as the pharmacokinetic\nproperties [83–85].\n7. Future of the Use of Somatostatin Receptors as Targets on Neuroendocrine T umors:\nSomatostatin Antagonists\nAn important development in the ﬁeld of SSTR targeting is the recent introduction\nof SSTR antagonists. SSTR antagonists seem to recognize more binding sites on receptors\nand show better tumor visualization than agonists and more favorable pharmacokinetics\ndespite a poor internalization rate [86,87].\nSeveral SSTR antagonists have been studied since 1996, in which Bass was developed\nﬁrst [ 88]. Of all the somatostatin antagonists developed so far, the analogue JR11 performed\nthe best in preclinical settings. JR11 has been selected both for clinical development as\na PET imaging agent labeled with 68Ga using the chelator NODAGA (68Ga-OPS202 or\n68Ga-NODAGA-JR11) and as a therapeutic agent labeled with 177Lu using the chelator\nDOTA (177Lu-OPS201 or 177Lu-DOTA-JR11) [89].', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 12 of 15\n5. Perspectives, Ongoing Studies\nThe role of PRRT in NETs is evolving. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization. A key\nchallenge remains to identify biomarkers, from imaging and molecular data, to predict\nPRRT response, towards a personalized treatment plan.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., F.T., and R.C.; methodol-\nogy, B.C., A.-S.C., and R.C.; validation, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; investigation,\nB.C. and A.-S.C.; resources, B.C., A.-S.C., R.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., and F.T.; data curation, B.C. and\nA.-S.C.; writing—original draft preparation, B.C. and A.-S.C.; writing—review and editing, B.C.,\nA.-S.C., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; visualization, R.C.; supervision, RC.; project administration, R.C.

Introduction\nNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare tumors characterized by the ability to synthe-\nsize, store, and secrete a variety of neuro-amines and peptides that can lead to secretory\nsyndrome. NETs are mainly from the digestive tract and bronchopulmonary, and their\nincidence has been steadily increasing in the last three decades [ 1]. NETs are biological and\nclinically heterogeneous. The potential for metastatic evolution and the ability to generate a\nsecretory syndrome vary considerably depending on the primary tumor location. For exam-\nple, NETs of the small intestine have a higher malignant potential while appendix or gastric\nNETs malignant are potentials are close to zero. Metastatic NETs of the midgut often secrete\nserotonin and other vasoactive substances, resulting in a typical carcinoid syndrome, mainly\ncharacterized by hot flashes, diarrhea and right valvular heart disease. More than 40% of\npatients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, which justifies the importance of a\ngood pre-therapeutic evaluation. In recent years, randomized trials validated several new\noptions such as targeted agents, including somatostatin analogues (SSA), everolimus and\nsunitinib. Since 1992, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has been developed as\na new therapeutic option in metastatic or non-resectable NET. This treatment corresponds\nto a form of systemic radiotherapy that allows targeted administration of systemic radio-\npharmaceuticals nucleides to tumor cells expressing high levels of somatostatin receptor\nJ.

Most frequently, these neoplasmsoccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrinecarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10% e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadicsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)since these are the most prevalent NENs at advanceddisease stages. In general, the management of othergastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)expression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n/C15Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent ofthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic NENs (GEP-NENs) constitute a\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronalphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines and\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cellsof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.\n1The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in theUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiologyand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence hasrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.\n1For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1 , available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33 e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from thenational and regional registries and are heterogeneous andmostly retrospective.\n2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically.', 'Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Prospective,\nRandomized Study on the Effect of Octreotide LAR in theControl of Tumor Growth in Patients With MetastaticNeuroendocrine Midgut Tumors: A Report From thePROMID Study Group\nAnja Rinke, Hans-Helge Mu ¨ller, Carmen Schade-Brittinger, Klaus-Jochen Klose, Peter Barth, Matthias Wied,\nChristina Mayer, Behnaz Aminossadati, Ulrich-Frank Pape, Michael Bla ¨ker, Jan Harder, Christian Arnold,\nThomas Gress, and Rudolf Arnold\nFrom the Department of Internal Medi-\ncine, Division of Gastroenterology andEndocrinology; Institute of MedicalBiometry and Epidemiology; Coordinat-ing Centre for Clinical Trials (KKS); andDepartments of Radiology and Pathol-ogy, Philipps University, Marburg;Department of Internal Medicine,Charité Medical School and Hospital(Virchow), Berlin; Department of Inter-nal Medicine, University of Hamburg,Hamburg; and Department of InternalMedicine, University of Freiburg,Freiburg, Germany.\nSubmitted March 20, 2009; accepted\nJune 24, 2009; published online aheadof print at www.jco.org on August 24,2009.\nWritten on behalf of the PROMID\nStudy Group and endorsed by the Euro-pean Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.\nSupported by grants from Novartis,\nNu¨rnberg, Germany.\nNovartis participated in the develop-\nment of the study design and providedthe verum medication and funding, butdid not participate in the collection,analysis, and interpretation of the data.\nAuthors’ disclosures of potential con-\nﬂicts of interest and author contribu-tions are found at the end of thisarticle.\nClinical Trials repository link available on\nJCO.org.\nCorresponding author: Rudolf Arnold,\nMD, Wittelsbacherstr 6, 80469Mu¨nchen, Germany; e-mail: arnoldr@\nmailer.uni-marburg.de.\nThe Acknowledgment is included in\nthe full-text version of this article,available online at www.jco.org.It is not included in the PDF version(via Adobe® Reader®).\n© 2009 by American Society of Clinical\nOncology\n0732-183X/09/2728-4656/$20.00DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.8510ABSTRACT\nPurpose\nSomatostatin analogs are indicated for symptom control in patients with gastroenteropancreatic\nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The ability of somatostatin analogs to control the growth ofwell-differentiated metastatic NETs is a matter of debate. We performed a placebo-controlled,double-blind, phase IIIB study in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs. Thehypothesis was that octreotide LAR prolongs time to tumor progression and survival.\nPatients and Methods\nTreatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or octreotide LAR 30 mg\nintramuscularly in monthly intervals until tumor progression or death. The primary efﬁcacy endpoint was time to tumor progression. Secondary end points were survival time and tumorresponse. This report is based on 67 tumor progressions and 16 observed deaths in 85 patientsat the time of the planned interim analysis.\nResults\nMedian time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6\nmonths, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] /H110050.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P/H11005.000072). After 6 months\nof treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and37.2% of patients in the placebo group. Functionally active and inactive tumors respondedsimilarly. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load andresected primary tumor. Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebogroups, respectively. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18).']"

27G advanced RAG,Was war das mediane PFS in der Netter-2 Studie?,german,specific,study,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"Das mediane PFS in der Netter-2-Studie betrug 11 Monate. (Kong et al., 2023)",,,,"['7,10The ongoing COMPETE trial is currently looking\nat this very question in GEPNETs, with one group beingrandomized to\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT and the other to\neverolimus.16For patients with pancreatic NETs, there are\nmore choices available, which include PRRT, sunitinib,everolimus, and capecitabine/temozolomide, which may\nhelp explain why over three quarters of patients initially\nreceived TT/CT instead of PRRT in this study. Greateruncertainty remains in patients with higher-grade tumors,\nwho did not appear to derive as much beneﬁt from PRRT.\nThe ongoing NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488), which israndomizing patients with higher-grade GEPNETs (well-\ndifferentiated, grade 2 and 3 with Ki-67 10–55%) to PRRT\n(with 30 mg Sandostatin LAR, q 4 weeks) vs high-doseSSAs, will help determine the efﬁcacy of PRRT in these\npatients. If a PFS beneﬁt is found in NETTER-2, the\nquestion of whether this is superior to TT or CT willremain, especially for patients with PNETs. That question\nmay be answered by the COMPOSE trial, comparing\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT to best standard of care (including\nall TT and CT) in aggressive grade 2 and grade 3 GEP-\nNETs.16Another relevant trial just opening is Alliance for\nClinical Trials in Oncology A022001 (ComPareNET;NCT05247905), which will randomize patients with pro-\ngressive, advanced, well-differentiated grade 1–3\npancreatic NETs to PRRT (\n177Lu-DOTATATE x 4 cycles)\nor 12 cycles of capecitabine/temozolomide.\nPusceddu et al. have given us valuable understanding of\ntreatment patterns of patients with progressive pancreatic\nand intestinal NETs in Italy, and how PRRT may improve\nPFS in many patients. However, it also suffers from thesame issues dogging all non-randomized studies in NETs.\nFirst is the concern with selection bias, which these authors\naddressed by propensity-matching. Second is the fact thatpatients usually live long enough to cross over to the other\ntherapeutic arm. Since overall survival was not affected in\nthis study, how can we be sure that giving PRRT before orafter TT/CT is better for patients? We do know that PRRT\nwith\n177Lu-DOTATATE is fairly safe, with low incidence\nof nephrotoxicity, a 2% rate of myelodysplastic syndromeor leukemia, and only 6% of patients having grade 3 or 4\nadverse events.\n8Grade 3 or 4 adverse events leading to\ntreatment discontinuation occurred in 12% of patientsreceiving everolimus in RADIANT-4,\n10and even more\ngrade 3 or 4 adverse events were seen in pancreatic NET\npatients treated with sunitinib.11Time to deterioration of\nquality of life may be another important measure to be\nconsidered when choosing the next therapy on progression.\nThis duration was signiﬁcantly longer in the177Lu-\nDOTATATE group in NETTER-1.15Although the results\nof the current study would seem to favor PRRT as the next6502 J. R. Howe', 'Other regimens \ninclude FOLFIRI, FOLFOX and CapTem. In terms of Iri-\nnotecan-5FU-based regimens, the ORR ranges from 17 to \n40%, PFS 4–5.8\xa0months and OS 5–11\xa0months [120– 122]. \nFor Oxaliplatin-5FU, PR ranges from 23 to 29%, PFS \n4.5\xa0months and OS 9.9\xa0months [123– 125]. CapeTem has also demonstrated activity in this setting [113]. However, \npatients with Ki-67 > 55% have worse outcomes [126]. \nThe SEcond-line therapy in NEuroendocrine CArcino-\nmas (SENECA) phase II study is evaluating FOLFIRI \nor CAPTEM post failure of first-line chemotherapy in \npatients with lung and NEC [127].\nPRRT is an option, as G3NETs have the greater propen-\nsity for SSTR expression relative to NECs: its utility here \nhas been reported by several small studies [31, 128– 130, \n131 ••]. In the largest series reported (N  = 69 G3NET/\nNEC), the median PFS was 9.6\xa0months, and the median OS \nwas 19.9\xa0months; for patients with Ki-67 ≤ 55% (n  = 53), \nthe median PFS was 11\xa0months and OS 22\xa0months, for \nthose with Ki-67 > 55% (n  = 11), 4\xa0months and 7\xa0months, \nrespectively [31]. An analysis of 4 studies where PRRT \nwas used in the second/third line setting: overall PFS was \n19\xa0months in G3NET, 11\xa0months for NEC (Ki-67 ≤ 55%) \nand 4\xa0months for NEC (Ki-67 > 55%) [131 ••]. Thus, \nPRRT may be considered for patients in G3 NENs with \nKi-67 < 55% [31, 131••]. Current trials include the phase \nIII COMPOSE study of 177Lu-DOTANOC versus sys-\ntemic therapy (NCT04919226) and the NETTER-2 phase \nIII trial randomising patients to PRRT versus high dose \nSSA (NCT03972488). PRRT is being combined with \nNivolumab (NCT04525638).\nICI is also promising in progressive high-grade NET \nand NEC, based on their higher TMB; the latter is greater \nin NECs and with microsatellite instability noted in 14% of \nNECs [132]. A meta-analysis of 10 heterogenous, single-\narm studies of ICI in NEN ( N = 464) found a pooled ORR \nof 15.5% [133). The response was based on primary site: \nwith thoracic NEN being more likely to respond than GEP-\nNEN (ORR 24.7% vs 9.5% respectively) and well-differ -\nentiated tumours having a lower response rate than NECs \n(ORR 10.4% vs 22.7% respectively) [133]. Very limited \nactivity has been observed with single-agent immuno-\ntherapy [134, 135], relative to combined PD1 and CTL4 \nblockade. From the CA209-538 study, 29 patients with \nheavily pre-treated NETs were treated with a combination \nof ipilimumab and nivolumab. Overall, in the 13 (45%) \nwith high-grade disease, the ORR was 24% and a DCR of \n72% [136 ••]. The SWOG S1609 DART trial reported the \nresults of the high-grade G3 NET/NEC cohort (N  = 19) \nwith a median Ki-67 value of 80%.

Median OS was 3.9 months for p a-\ntients who received one cycle of 177Lu-DOTATOC in \ncontrast to 34.7 months for patie nts who received >1 \ncycle. Median OS for GEP -NET patients who received \n>1 cycle was also 34.7 months, while for patients with \nNET of other origins who received >1 cycle OS was \n16.2 months (Table 5).  \nObjective Response Rate (ORR), defined as pro-\nportion of patients achieving partial (PR) or complete \nresponse (CR), per RECIST 1.1 criteria [16] was 33.9% (19 of 56) in the total population. In all patients who received >1 cycle ORR was 40.6% (13 of 32), while for GEP -NET patients with >1 cycle it was 54% (13 of  24), \nand complete remission was recorded in 16.1%, 18.8%, \nand 25.0%, respectively. Disease Control Rate (DCR, \nencompassing CR, PR and SD) was achieved in 66.1% (37 of 56) of all treated patients and in 93.8% (30 of 32) patients who received >1 cycle, and in all (100%) \nGEP -NET patients with >1 cycle (Table 6).

Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.

The MEN1 gene encodes the menin protein involved in the\nregulation of gene transcription and mutation carriers will have clinicalmanifestations by the age of 50 years. The syndrome is associated\nwith parathyroid adenomas, duodenopancreatic NET and anterior\npituitary adenomas with a lifetime prevalence of 80% for NF-Pan-NET. MEN1 syndrome associates less frequently with thymic, lung\nand gastric NET and other tumours, and it is thus important to moni-\ntor patients for other neoplasms. Early recognition of relatives withMEN1 syndrome is of outmost importance due to 50% probability offirst line family members being carriers and also in the light of possible\ngenetic anticipation.\n84\nPan-NET arising in the context of MEN1 syndrome are usually\nmultiple, nonfunctioning and may develop early in the second decade\nof life.85The current state of evidence suggests initial close follow up\nwith MRI to assess growth rate alternating with EUS. SRI-PET may becarried out when it may change management such as in NF-Pan-NET\n>1 cm for detection of occult metastases or before interventions are\nconsidered.\n86,87\nSeveral studies have indicated that MEN1-associated NF-\nPan-NET usually exhibit a low propensity to grow and lesions <2 cm\ncan be simply followed up by observation. If they are NET G2-G3,have lymph node metastases and are >3 cm in diameter, surgical exci-sion is then considered as they may display metastatic potential.\n88For\nlesions between 2 and 3 cm there is uncertainty, and more studies are\nrequired prior to being able to make recommendations.']"

Introduction\nTheranostics is an emerging and expanding concept in the biomedical ﬁeld based on\nthe selection of the patients’ eligibility to therapeutic interventions following a dedicated\nimaging procedure to verify the presence of a biological target. Iodine-131 was used as\nthe ﬁrst therapeutic application in nuclear medicine since the 1940s. The availability of\nIodine-123 a few years later allowed for the ﬁrst approach to what would become theranos-\ntics based on a pair of radionuclides, one of which is used for diagnosis and the other for\ntherapy [1,2] . Since then, no other radioisotope based theranostic approach (radiotheranos-\ntics) has been approved for clinical use until recently [ 2]. Radiotheranostics is characterized\nby a combination of a diagnostic tracer targeting a biomarker of interest imaged with\npositron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography\n(SPECT). Depending on the target level of expression and localization, the patient can be\nselected for therapeutic intervention with a corresponding radiopharmaceutical that has\nthe same or similar structure but a different embedded radionuclide. Such a strategy allows\nfor therapy monitoring with an iterative imaging procedure using PET or SPECT [3].\nPharmaceutics 2023 ,15, 1240. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15041240 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics']"

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue .

INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).']"

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

The most often used method of infusion is thegravity method, by which the complete dose is effectively adminis-tered exponentially. However, there is no evidence to explicitly sup-\nport an infusion time of 30 min. This study aims to investigate the\nsafety of an infusion time of less than 5 min. Methods: A cohort study\nwas performed, examining the biochemical and clinical toxicity afterPRRT when using a fast-infusion protocol with a maximum infusion\ntime of 5 min. Data on patient characteristics, laboratory tests, follow-\nup visits, and pre- and posttreatment imaging using\n68Ga-DOTATOC\nPET/CT from patients treated with PRRT at the University MedicalCenter Utrecht (UMC Utrecht) were collected. All patients receiving\nPRRT using the fast-infusion protocol were included. If no laboratory\nor clinical follow-up was available, patients were excluded. In addition,a laboratory experiment was performed, simulating the standard-infu-\nsion protocol using the gravity method. Results: Thirty-one patients,\ntreated using the fast-infusion protocol, were included. Clinical toxicitymainly consisted of grade 1/2 fatigue (87.1%) and grade 1 nausea orvomiting (67.7%) during follow-up. No acute or long-term clinical tox-\nicity possibly related to the fast-infusion protocol was reported. Grade\n3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred after PRRT in 1 patient (3.2%). Nograde 3/4 renal toxicity occurred. The laboratory experiment showedthat when using the gravity method for infusion, half of the activity is\ninfused after 3.5 min, and 95% is infused within 15 min.

PRRT uses the radioactive isotope\n177Lu, coupled to a peptide that mainly targets somatostatin sub-\ntype 2 receptors. These receptors are often highly overexpressedon the cell surface of NENs and some other type of tumors(5,6). The radiopharmaceutical binds to the receptor with high\nafﬁnity and is internalized by the tumor cells after intravenous\nadministration. The presence of the somatostatin subtype 2 re-\nceptors can easily be made visible by\n68Ga-somatostatin receptor\nPET/CT (68Ga-SSTR PET/CT) ( 7). The treatment is safe, as tox-\nicity is limited to grade I –II hematotoxicity in less than 10% of pa-\ntients and is often transient ( 3,8,9). Grade III or IV hematotoxicity\nor a decreased renal function rarely occur after treatment with\nPRRT. When PRRT is administered, multiple precautionary meas-\nures are taken to ensure a safe infusion for the patient as well as thehealth-care personnel performing the administration ( 10,11 ).', 'A positive PPQ measured before the start\nof PRRT accurately predicted the outcome of disease control after PRRT in 97% of cases,\nwhereas a negative PPQ was associated with PD after PRRT in 61% of cases at 2 months and\n89% at 6–9 months after PRRT [ 59]. Levels of the NETest, a circulating transcript analysis\nof 51 genes, during and after PRRT were found to be associated with response according\nto RECIST on imaging [ 60]. A lack of decrease in NETest levels at the fourth PRRT cycle\nsigniﬁed the advent of PD in advance of imaging, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of\n93% to predict response [61].\n4. PRRT Protocol\nThe eligibility of a patient to receive PRRT should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team\nin a specialized NET center for each individual patient. Although multiple protocols for PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE have been proposed, the most commonly used treatment schedule\nentails four cycles of 7.4 GBq177Lu-DOTATATE, which is based on the Rotterdam Erasmus\nMC protocol and also used in the NETTER-1 study [ 27,29]. The interval between cycles is\n6 to 10 weeks. In case of toxicity, this interval can be extended up to 16 weeks [ 2,3,27]. In\nparallel with the administration of177Lu-DOTATATE, an amino acid solution of 2.5% arginine\nand lysine in 1 L saline is co-infused in order to prevent renal toxicity. This infusion starts\napproximately 30–60 min before the administration of177Lu-DOTATATE with a total infusion\ntime of 4 h.

The molecular basis of PRRT with [177Lu] Lu-DOTA-TATE is the internalization and retention of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs in the lysosomes of cells expressing SSTR-2. This results in the breakdown of intracellular DNA chains and cell death due to beta irradiation, as well as low-energy gamma radiation for imaging.

Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy \nThe first radiopharmaceutical used in th is field was 111In-Pentetreotide and its \nclinical efficacy was attributed to the effect  of Auger and conversion electrons. It was \nabandoned in Europe as a therapy option in favor of the more efficient β emitters 90Y and \n177Lu. Peptide receptor radionuclide ther apy (PRRT) on GEP NENs target SSTR2 bind-\ning actively to it. The radiopharmaceutical used  in PRRT involves a triple structure: ra-\ndioactive metal, whose radiation ( β) allows the destruction of tumor cells; a chelating \nagent with a dual role, which binds the radiom etal and allows it to bind to the carrier \nthrough a functionalized arm; and a targeting moiety (peptide), which is aimed at SSTR2 \n[50]. \nCompounds available include 90Y-DOTATOC (PRRT-Y), which were firstly devel-\noped, and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (PRRT-Lu), which is the only PRRT approved for \nGEP NET patients in Europe and North America (Lutathera®). This section is not man-\ndatory but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex. \nThe molecular basis of therapy with [177Lu] Lu-DOTA-TATE is internalization and \nretention of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs in lysosomes of cells which express SSTR-2.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.\nThree radionuclides (\n111In,90Y , and177Lu) have been con-\njugated to SSAs (Table 2), and their different physical proper-\nties allow for specific benefits in radiation delivery [ 13].\nStudies in the 1990s used high activities of the Augerelectron-emitting [\n111In-DTPA0]octreotide for PRRT.Table 1 ENETS/WHO nomenclature and classification for digestive system neuroendocrine tumors [ 1]\nDifferentiation Grade Mitotic count*Ki-67\nindex+Traditional ENETS,WHO\nWell-differentiated Low grade (G1) < 2 per 10 HPF < 3% Carcinoid, islet cell, pancreatic (neuro)endocrine\ntumorNeuroendocrine tumor,\ngrade 1\nIntermediate\ngrade (G2)2 to 20 per 10 HPF 3 –20% Carcinoid, atypical carcinoidΔ, islet cell,\npancreatic (neuro)endocrine tumorNeuroendocrine tumor,\ngrade 2\nPoorly differentiated High grade (G3) > 20 per 10 HPF > 20% Small cell carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine\ncarcinomaNeuroendocrine carcinoma,\ngrade 3, small cell\nENETS European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, WHO World Health Organization\n*Counted in 10 high-power fields (HPF). 10 HPF = 2 mm2, at least 40 fields (at ×400 magnification) evaluated in areas of highest mitotic density.

The two most commonly used radio-peptides for radionuclide therapy in\nneuroendocrine tumors are90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. Radio-peptides have been used for\nseveral years in the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Recently, the randomized Phase\nIII study NETTER-1 compared177Lu-DOTATATE versus high-dose (double-dose) octreotide LAR in\npatients with metastatic midgut neuroendocrine tumors, and demonstrated its efﬁcacy in this setting.\nStrong signals in favor of efﬁciency seem to exist for other tumors, in particular for pancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. This focus on radionuclide therapy in gastroenteropancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors addresses the treatment modalities, the validated and potential\nindications, and the safety of the therapy.\nKeywords: neuroendocrine tumors; neoplasm metastasis; PRRT; peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy; gastroenteropancreatic tumor; pulmonary tumor\n1.', 'FOCUS ON MOLECULAR IMAGING\nNew Developments in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\nGuillaume P.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 11 of 17\nof patients treated with PRRT who had mesenteric and/or peritoneal metastases ranged\nfrom 6–51% [ 27,117,118]. In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

34E advanced RAG,What is the major requirement for a patient to be treated with PRRT?,english,general,requirements,command-r-plus advanced RAG,"A major requirement for a patient to be treated with PRRT is that they have grade 1 or 2 NETs that are inoperable and metastatic, and have failed first-line somatostatin treatment (Hirmas et al., 2018).",,,,"['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', 'When appropriate patient selection is performed, PRRT is accompanied by limited risks\nfor renal and hematological toxicities.

PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3].

The antitumoral\neffect of PRRT is triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage. After binding to the SSTR 2,\nthe radiopharmaceutical agonists are internalized into the tumor cell where the irradiation\ninduces different types of DNA damage such as DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA\ndouble strand breaks (DSBs) of which the latter are the major contributors to tumor cell\ndeath induction [10,11] (Figure 1).\nCancers 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  2 of 18  \n SSAs target the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over -expressed on the can-\ncer cell surface [4] .
