Recently, a\nstudy abstract from the European Pancreatic Club (EPC) 2017meeting [ 47] compared patients with initially metastatic and/or\nlocally advanced pNETs who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT\nwith a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery.After PRRT, tumor size decreased from 59 to 50 mm, and the\nrate of curative resection was 65%. The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).\nAdjuvant PRRT\nPRRT may also be used in an adjuvant setting after surgery ofGEP-NETs, preventing tumor growth after surgical manipula-tion or preventing further growth of pre-existing\nmicrometastases. Unfortunately, only a handful of studiesare available on postoperative treatment with PRRT. Thereare no published randomized trials on adjuvant PRRT favor-\ning any evidence on the best treatment approach in this subset\nof patients.\nOne study [ 48]i n c l u d e dp a t i e n t sw i t hG 1 –G2 pNETs and\nsynchronous liver metastases who were not eligible for liversurgery but were amenable to upfront PRRT. The prospectivestudy followed 94 patients, 31 of whom previously underwent\nprimary resection while the rest had no previous surgeries\nperformed. Both groups were treated with PRRT, either\n90Y-\nDOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE. The resection of the prima-\nry tumor was significantly associated with better PR or SDafter PRRT and longer median PFS and OS for operated ver-sus non-operated patients. In this study, only patients with\nsynchronous pNET and liver metastases treated with PRRT\nwere considered, excluding those who underwent primary tu-mor and liver surgery with radical intent. Patients affected by a\nG3 tumor according to the WHO 2010 classification and those\nwho had undergone PRRT at disease progression under so-matostatin analogs were excluded.\nEven though it did not cover surgery per se, one study [ 49]\ncompared patients who received PRRTwho had received priorchemo or radionuclide hepatic embolization (CRHE) with\nthose who did not have any prior history of such intervention.\nA total of 70% of patients who had CRHE (compared to56.5% who did not) experienced benefit from\n177Lu PRRT,\nand 21.6% who had CRHE (compared to 35.8% who did not)experienced progression. Patients with a pervious history of\nCRHE also showed more SD and less PD following PRRT\nwhen compared to the patients who did not have any priorCRHE, but the probability of developing CR and PR is not\nstatistically different between both groups.\nTo detect a difference in survival and/or tumor recurrence\nrate in patients treated with and without adjuvant PRRT, alarge, multicenter trial with several years of follow-up would\nbe needed.Nucl Med Mol Imaging (2018) 52:190 –199 195', 'Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAmbrosini et al.

In cases of patients with non-resectable or disseminated NET and treated with PRRT, which imaging techniques do you recommend for monitoring response to therapy?', 'One of them\ndied postoperatively from surgi cal complications. Recently, a\nstudy abstract from the European Pancreatic Club (EPC) 2017meeting [ 47] compared patients with initially metastatic and/or\nlocally advanced pNETs who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT\nwith a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery.After PRRT, tumor size decreased from 59 to 50 mm, and the\nrate of curative resection was 65%. The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).\nAdjuvant PRRT\nPRRT may also be used in an adjuvant setting after surgery ofGEP-NETs, preventing tumor growth after surgical manipula-tion or preventing further growth of pre-existing\nmicrometastases. Unfortunately, only a handful of studiesare available on postoperative treatment with PRRT. Thereare no published randomized trials on adjuvant PRRT favor-\ning any evidence on the best treatment approach in this subset\nof patients.\nOne study [ 48]i n c l u d e dp a t i e n t sw i t hG 1 –G2 pNETs and\nsynchronous liver metastases who were not eligible for liversurgery but were amenable to upfront PRRT. The prospectivestudy followed 94 patients, 31 of whom previously underwent\nprimary resection while the rest had no previous surgeries\nperformed. Both groups were treated with PRRT, either\n90Y-\nDOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE. The resection of the prima-\nry tumor was significantly associated with better PR or SDafter PRRT and longer median PFS and OS for operated ver-sus non-operated patients. In this study, only patients with\nsynchronous pNET and liver metastases treated with PRRT\nwere considered, excluding those who underwent primary tu-mor and liver surgery with radical intent. Patients affected by a\nG3 tumor according to the WHO 2010 classification and those\nwho had undergone PRRT at disease progression under so-matostatin analogs were excluded.\nEven though it did not cover surgery per se, one study [ 49]\ncompared patients who received PRRTwho had received priorchemo or radionuclide hepatic embolization (CRHE) with\nthose who did not have any prior history of such intervention.\nA total of 70% of patients who had CRHE (compared to56.5% who did not) experienced benefit from\n177Lu PRRT,\nand 21.6% who had CRHE (compared to 35.8% who did not)experienced progression. Patients with a pervious history of\nCRHE also showed more SD and less PD following PRRT\nwhen compared to the patients who did not have any priorCRHE, but the probability of developing CR and PR is not\nstatistically different between both groups.\nTo detect a difference in survival and/or tumor recurrence\nrate in patients treated with and without adjuvant PRRT, alarge, multicenter trial with several years of follow-up would\nbe needed.Nucl Med Mol Imaging (2018) 52:190 –199 195']"

Nicolas1, Alfred Morgenstern2, Margret Schottelius3, and Melpomeni Fani4\n1Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland;2Joint Research Centre,\nDirectorate for Nuclear Safety and Security, European Commission, Karlsruhe, Germany;3Institute of Pharmaceutical\nRadiochemistry, Technische Universit¨ at M¨ unchen, Garching, Germany; and4Division of Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry, University\nHospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established\ntreatment for nonoperable or metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms\nthat highly and frequently express somatostatin receptors. More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).']"

Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing. In such cases,\n177Lu-labelled pepti-\nd e ss h o u l db eu s e da n dt h ea d m i n i s t e r e da c t i v i t ys h o u l db e\nreduced accordingly. After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'Antiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting.

PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']"

INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).']"

In the current era, the \nintegration of molecular imaging (SSTR and FDG PET/\nCT) and molecular profiling (IHC profile and genomic \nanalyses) can provide important disease characterisa-\ntion, to guide precision management and individualised \ntreatment selection/sequencing (see Fig.\xa0 1). This is par -\nticularly crucial for patients with advanced high-grade \nNENs and to resolve G3 NET vs NEC disease biology, \nas clinical behaviour and treatment options can differ \nsignificantly. It is also imperative to focus on incorpo-\nrating prospective serial translational genomic analy -\nsis of tissue and blood, to develop novel liquid biopsy \nand tumour testing methodologies to understand NEN \npathogenesis, discover predictive and prognostic bio-\nmarkers to explain the differential response to therapy \nand subsequently guide future trial design for rational \ntreatment allocation. Using multidisciplinary diagnostic \napproaches should be the focus of future development \nto improve individualised therapy and patient outcomes.\nConclusion\nWe are in an exciting era for the biological interrogation of \nneuroendocrine neoplasms to guide precision management \nby incorporating molecular imaging assessment with clini-\ncally relevant molecular pathology pathway and genomic \nevaluation. Our technological capability for precision \ndiagnosis needs to be developed in parallel with therapy \nadvancements in patients with advanced-stage higher-\ngrade NEN and globally is only a reality for patients who \nhave geographical or financial access to major NEN refer -\nral centres [138]. It is therefore imperative not only to \nplace molecular imaging and genomics at the centre of \nNEN patient management but to also show the sympto-\nmatic, survival and health economic benefits of doing so \nthrough high-quality research such that these technolo-\ngies are widely supported by guidelines and imbursed by \nregulatory bodies.\nAcknowledgements Dr. Catherine Mitchell reported the histopathol-\nogy displayed in Fig.\xa0 1.\nFunding  Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and \nits Member Institutions\nDeclarations  \nConflict of Interest All authors declare no conflict of interest.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply. With patient benefit as the driving principle \nfor all we do, ITM is advancing a broad pipeline , including two phase III studies,  combining its high -\nquality  radioisotopes with targetin g molecules to develop  precision oncology treatments.

In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting. Oncology nursing\nstaff are often more accustomed to the complexities of required\nconcomitant medication infusions and patient monitoring than\nnuclear medicine staff, but nuclear medicine staff are well\ntrained in radiation safety and the necessary precautions required\nduring administration of radioa ctivity. If a combination approach\nis taken (i.e., the patient is transported between departments for\nspeciﬁc components of the proced ure), extra caution regarding\nradiation protection is require d for patient travel. When treated\nas an outpatient, a patient should be forewarned of the uncommon\npossibility of an overnight hospital stay should a complication such\nas a neuroendocrine hormonal crisis or severe emesis occur ( 6).\nROOM PREPARATION\nBecause body ﬂuids (primarily urine) are radioactive after177Lu-\nDOTATATE administration, room preparation is essential to reduce\npotential contamination. For example, patient stretchers, chairs,\nﬂoors, and lower walls can be covered with a prophylactic protective\ncovering ( Fig. 2). Furthermore, whereas a treatment suite with an\nFIGURE 1.

However, in the literature, the term \ntheranostics  has been more frequently associated \nwith some in vivo nuclear medicine oncologic \napplications; this scenario exemplifies the modern \nconcept of theranostics and is the main focus of \ndiscussion in this article. Therefore, throughout \nthis article, theranostics  will be used in reference to \nnuclear medicine theranostics specifically.\nContextualization of Nuclear \nTheranostics\nNuclear medicine imaging is mainly based on \nthe principle of using radioactive isotopes linked \nto specific molecules (ie, radiopharmaceutical \nagents or radiotracers) to assess key biologic \npathways, especially the pathophysiologic features \nof diseases (8). Therapy in nuclear medicine acts \nin the same way: Radiopharmaceutical agents \nare used to target diseased tissue, with radiation \napplied at the cellular level by way of a specific \nchemical and/or biologic affinity. The imaging or \ntherapeutic capability of each radioisotope is de-\ntermined according to the type of radiation emit-\nted because electromagnetic radiation (ie, γ rays) \ncan be detected by imaging systems (scintigraphy, \nSPECT, and PET), and particulate irradiations \nhave cytotoxic (ie, therapeutic) properties (Fig 1).\nThere are two main forms of particulate radia -\ntion used for therapeutic applications: radiation \nwith α particles and radiation with β particles \n(which are electrons). These two forms of radia -\ntion share a common feature: a high transfer of \nenergy to tissues that leads to severe cellular injury \ndue to DNA damage. The α particles have higher \nenergy and much greater mass. Some isotopes (eg, \nlutetium 177 [177Lu]) can emit both electromag -comprehension, discovery, and design of drugs, \nserving as the basis of modern chemotherapy and \ntargeted therapies in medicine (2). More than \n100 years after being proposed, the magic bullet \nconcept remains current and influences the search \nand development of specific effective and harmless \nmolecule-driven treatments for human diseases, \nmost notably cancer. Recently, terms such as \npersonalized medicine, targeted medicine, and precision \nmedicine  have been used to represent this idea.\nAs a central component of patient care, imag-\ning has followed, and often made possible, dis-\ncoveries of drugs and treatments, evolving from a \nvaluable diagnostic tool to a now powerful guide \nfor enhancing disease characterization, patient \nselection, prediction of treatment response and \ntissue toxicity, and determination of the prog-\nnosis (3,4). In summary, imaging is integrated \ninto therapy now more than ever before. In this \ncontext, an approach referred to as theranostics \nhas been frequently used.
