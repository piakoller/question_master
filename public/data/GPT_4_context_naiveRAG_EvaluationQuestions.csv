According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140].

PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'Lutetium-177- DOTATATE/\nDOTATOC for treatment of\nGastroenteropancreatic NETs\nNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are relatively rare\nneoplasms which may arise from pluripotential stem cells in\naddition to cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system\ncomprising the autonomic nervous system, the thyroid, lungs,\npancreas and gastrointestinal tract ( 2).

2E naive RAG,For which indication is PRRT approved?,english,specific,therapy,gpt-4-turbo naive RAG,"PRRT is approved for the treatment of adult patients with SST-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) (Fani et al., 2022).",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', '2.2. Clinical Studies and Approvals\nToday, PRRT with radiolabeled SST agonists (e.g., DOTA-TOC or DOTA-TATE, Table 1)\nis part of the standard of care of NENs. NETTER-1 (NCT01578239; EudraCT number\n2011-005049-11 ) was the ﬁrst prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial to com-\npare four cycles of177Lu-DOTA-TATE (4 ×7.4 GBq) plus 30 mg long-acting release oc-\ntreotide (PRRT group, n = 117) with high-dose (60 mg double dose) long-acting release\noctreotide (control group, n = 114) in advanced, progressive midgut NET patients. There\nwas a signiﬁcantly longer progression-free survival for the PRRT arm ( p< 0.001) [ 22]\nand a signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life [ 23].

These\ntrials and other trials (e.g., OCCLURANDOM, NCT02230176) should further precisely\ndetermine the position of PRRT in the current clinical algorithm with regard to other\nsystemic therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib.\nUsing routes other than intravenous administration may be an interesting approach to\nenhance the therapeutic and safety window of PRRT. NENs and their liver metastases are\noften highly perfused, and the intra-arterial route can exploit the ﬁrst-pass effect to treat\nliver-dominant disease more efﬁciently. Such an approach can also be used for inoperable\nprimary tumors to downstage the disease in the neoadjuvant setting [ 25,26].

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).']"

DOTATOC is the\nabbreviated form of [DOTA0,Tyr3]-\noctreotide, where DOTA stands for thebifunctional chelating molecule 1,4,7,10-\ntetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid, and Tyr3-octreotide is themodified octreotide. This peptide shows a\nhigh affinity for sstr2 (IC\n5014±2.6 nM),\nbut lower affinities for sstr5 (IC 50393±84\nnM) and sstr3 (IC 50880±324 nM) [ 3].\nDOTATATE DOTATATE is also a derivatized\nsomatostatin analogue peptide.DOTATATE is the abbreviated form of\n[DOTA0,Tyr3,Thr8]-octreotide or\n[DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotate, and DOTAstands for the bifunctional metal-\nchelating molecule. This peptide shows\na six- to ninefold higher affinity forsstr2 (IC\n501.5±0.4 nM) than DOTA-\nTOC, but has no affinity for either\nsstr5 (IC 50547±160 nM) or sstr3\n(IC50>1,000 nM) [ 4].\nBackgroundNETs have proven to be ideal neoplasms for PRRNT, as the\nmajority of these slow-growing malignancies overexpresssstrs. Appropriate candidates for PRRNT are patients present-\ning with well-differentiated or moderately differentiated neu-\nroendocrine carcinomas, defined as NETs of grade 1 or 2according to the WHO classification of 2010 [ 5]. The inci-\ndence of NETs has been rising over the past 30 years, partic-\nularly those arising from the midgut and pancreas [ 6]. The\nincidence of NETs in the USA rose from 10.9 to 52.4 per\nmillion between 1973 and 2004 (SEER database). NETs can\no c c u ri nc h i l d r e na n dy o u n ga d u l t s ,b e i n gd i a g n o s e da se a r l ya sat the age of 5 years, while their incidence increases with age.\nThe clinical presentation may vary depending on the site of\ntumour origin. About 72 % of NETs arise in gastrointestinalstructures, 25 % are bronchopulmonary in origin, and less than\n5 % arise at other sites (e.g. thymus, breast and genitourinary\nsystem). Frequently, these tumours are discovered when meta-static or locally advanced and therefore inoperable. NETs can\nbe either functioning or nonfunctioning in nature. Functioning\ntumours are associated with clinical syndromes, such as thecarcinoid syndrome (due to the release of serotonin).', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy. In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'long-term safety of PRRT in NET.

ESMO Guidelines\nrecommend the use of Lu-177-DOTATATE following\nsomatostatin analogue therapy, for the treatment of patients\nwith carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and/or ﬂushing. PRRT is also\nrecommended for patients with GE NETs who have progressive\ndisease following treatment with somatostatin analogues or with\neverolimus and for PNETs following treatment with everolimus,\nsunitinib or chemotherapy (capecitabine and temozolomide/\nstreptozotocin and 5- ﬂuorouracil).\nAlthough PRRT for the treatment of patients with NETs has\nprovided a new paradigm for the management of patients with\nadvanced metastatic disease, the optimal treatment regimen and\nalso the positioning of PRRT in the treatment algorithm remain\nto be de ﬁned. At the present time, patients received a standard\nactivity/dose of treatment at ﬁxed intervals of 8 weeks\n(Lutathera) or 12 weeks (COMPETE study). The currenttreatment regimens are based on empirical observations in the\nclinic. Opportunities for further improving the management of\npatients are expected with new antagonist targeting molecules\nand the application of radionuclides which with different\nphysicochemical properties to Lu-177. A number of clinical\ntrials with PRRT in NETs are currently ongoing ( Table 3 ).The future of targeted radiotherapy in\nNETS\nAt the present time, patients receive a standardized\ntreatment regimen of ~7,5GBq 8-12 weekly for 4 cycles. There\nis a great deal of interest in individualizing patients ’therapy\nregimens based on dosimetry. All patients in the COMPETE\nstudy undergo dosimetric evaluation with 2D planar imaging at\n0,5 hrs, 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 72-96 hrs after the ﬁrst infusion and\nSPECT/CT for hybrid 2D/3D dosimetry at 24 hrs post each\ninfusion. Sub-study A will compare the cumulative absorbed\ndoses to kidneys and target lesions extrapolated from dose 1 to\nthe cumulative absorbed dose from all 4 infusions. In sub-study\nB, the absorbed dose estimated by 3D dosimetry will be\ncompared to estimates from planar 2D and hybrid 2D/3D\ndosimetry. It is expected that the dosimetry data from these\nstudies will facilitate the a pplication of dosimetry to\nindividualized therapy, rather than the standard ‘one size ﬁts\nall’approach.\nThe currently available data for PRRT of NET patients are\nmainly for those with advanced disease, who have receivedprevious therapies. These patients inevitably relapse at some\nstage. Earlier positioning in the treatment algorithm is of\nparticular interest and data for the ﬁrst-line therapy will be\nforthcoming from COMPETE ,C O M P O S Ea n dN E T T E R - 2\ntrials. Neoadjuvant therapy in PNETs is a subject of interest\nwith anectodal reports of bene ﬁcial surgical outcomes in some\npatients ( 31).\nIt is apparent from dosimetry and safety that many patients\nare able to receive and bene ﬁt from additional cycles of\ntreatment ( 32,33).', 'Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.']"

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'A positive PPQ measured before the start\nof PRRT accurately predicted the outcome of disease control after PRRT in 97% of cases,\nwhereas a negative PPQ was associated with PD after PRRT in 61% of cases at 2 months and\n89% at 6–9 months after PRRT [ 59]. Levels of the NETest, a circulating transcript analysis\nof 51 genes, during and after PRRT were found to be associated with response according\nto RECIST on imaging [ 60].

The interval between cycles is\n6 to 10 weeks. In case of toxicity, this interval can be extended up to 16 weeks [ 2,3,27].

NETs can be im-\naged using somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labeled with68Ga (68Ga-\nDOTATATE and68Ga-DOTATOC) ( 2).b-emitting radionuclides\nsuch as177Lu can be used for PRRT ( 3). The NETTER-1 trial\ndemonstrated prolonged progression-free survival in midgut NET\npatients treated with 4 cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE, which subse-\nquently led to the approval of this therapy ( 4).\nTREATMENT OVERVIEW\n177Lu-DOTATATE is administered at an activity of 7.4 GBq\n(200 mCi) every 8 61 wk for 4 cycles. Combined with prophy-\nlactic amino acid infusions and antiemetics, each treatment visit\ncan last approximately 5–8 h ( Fig. 1). Before starting PRRT treat-\nments, each treatment site must ensure that177Lu is included in their\ninstitutional radioactive materials license. A detailed review of pro-\ncedures surrounding177Lu-DOTATATE therapy is provided below.\nPATIENT SCREENING\nPatients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary NET team,\nincluding a cancer specialist with expertise in the medical man-\nagement of NETs as well as a nuclear medicine physician or\nappropriate authorized user to decide on the appropriateness and\ntiming of PRRT in individual patients. Potential candidates should\nundergo an SSTR PET scan or SSTR scintigraphy (111In-pentetreotide)\nto demonstrate adequate SSTR expression ( 2). Traditionally, SSTR\nexpression on111In-pentetreotide greater than background hepatic\nuptake has been considered an eligibility requirement for PRRT\n(5). Necessary levels of SSTR expression on68Ga-based SSTR\nPET have not been clearly deﬁned, but lesion uptake should ex-\nceed background hepatic uptake. Laboratory values should be\nchecked shortly before the treatment is ordered (typically 2 wk\nbefore each cycle). These should include blood urea nitrogen,\ncreatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, white blood cell\nwith differential, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. The threshold\nvalues provided in Table 1 should be taken as general eligibility\nguidelines for therapy.SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG THERAPY\nSSA therapy is used frequently to treat NET patients, and SSAs\nare typically administered in depot formulations every 4 wk. It is\nrecommended that PRRT treatments be scheduled at least 4 wk\nafter the last long-acting SSA therapy to prevent interference with\nSSTR binding. For symptomatic patients, short-acting SSAs being\nused as a bridge should be stopped at least 24 h before treatment.\nSubsequent SSA doses can be administered as soon as several hours\nafter the completion of the radiopharmaceutical therapy. During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy.

In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'however, still used by some in the USA mainly due to the lack\nof availability of β-emitting radiotracers. High-energy βemit-\nters, such as90Y with a longer βrange in soft tissue, were\nconsidered more promising for the treatment of bulky tumour.\nA novel analogue, Tyr3-octreotide, with a similar affinity\nprofile for sstrs, was developed. Linked to a macrocyclicchelator (DOTA), it allows simple and stable radiolabelling\nof\n111In and90Y to [DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-DOTA-\nTOC) [ 44]. PRRNT using90Y-DOTATOC was first used in\n1996 in a patient in Basel, Switzerland. The excellent subjec-\ntive and objective response following several cycles of90Y-\nDOTATOC led to high expectations as to the therapeuticpotential of PRRNT in patients with NET. Since then other\ncentres worldwide have conducted clinical trials with\n90Y-\nDOTATOC [ 45]. Since the year 2000, octreotate (Tyr3,Thr8-\noctreotide), a newer analogue with improved affinity for sstr2,\nhas been synthesized. The chelated analogue [DOTA0,Tyr3]-\noctreotate (DOTATATE) can be labelled with the β-a n d γ-\nemitting isotope177Lu and has been used in clinical studies.\nIndications and contraindications\nIndications\nPRRNT is indicated for the treatment of patients with\npositive expression of sstr2, or metastatic or inoperable\nNET [ 46–50]. Candidate patients for PRRNT using\nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues are mainly those\nwith sstr2-expressing NET of the gastroenteropancreatic\nand bronchial tracts, but may also include patients withphaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma [ 51]\nor medullary thyroid carcinoma [ 52–56]. The ideal can-\ndidates for PRRNT are those w ith well-differentiated\nand moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas\ndefined as NET grade 1 or 2 according to the recent\nWHO 2010 classification [ 4].\nContraindications\nAbsolute\n&Pregnancy.\n&Severe acute concomitant illnesses.\n&Severe unmanageable psychiatric disorder.\nRelative\n&Breast feeding (if not discontinued).\n&Severely compromised renal function: for PRRNT with\na\n90Y-labelled peptide age-adjusted normal renal func-\ntion is essential. Patients with compromised renal func-\ntion may still be considered for177Lu-labelled peptidetreatment. For177Lu-labelled peptide a mild to moderate\ngrade of renal impairment can be tolerated (e.g. creati-\nnine ≤1.7 mg/dl). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and\ntubular extraction rate (TER) should be at least 60 % of\nmean age-adjusted normal values.\n&Severely compromised bone marrow: noncompromised\nhaematological reserve should be present before\nPRRNT. Suggested reference values are:\nWBC <3,000/ μl, with absolute neutrophil count <1,000/ μl\nPLT <75,000/ μl for177Lu-DOTATATE, <90,000/ μl for\n90Y-DOTATOC,\nRBC <3,000,000/ μl.\nSpecial warnings\nRenal function\nThe kidney is the dose-limiting organ at the activities\nnormally used for PRRNT. Side effects involving the\nkidney and the bone marrow are mild if adequate renalprotection and fractionation are used. Renal function\nshould be assessed by means of laboratory tests (creat-\ninine and BUN), or calculation of creatinine clearance(e.g. Cockroft-Gault formula ). Additional studies, e.g.\nmeasurement of GFR with 24-h urine collection or\nnuclear medicine methods (e.g.\n99mTc-MAG3 with\nTER determination,99mTc-DTPA GFR or effective renal\nplasma flow using hippuran), should be performed in\npatients with risk factors for renal toxicity or withcompromised renal function, and in all children.']"

The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation.

Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 4 of 17\n3.2. Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 4 of 17\n3.2. Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

Adverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild, such as nausea, abdominal pain, and asthenia, but more severe toxicities can occur, affecting critical organs like the kidneys and bone marrow. Additionally, PRRT is contraindicated for certain patient groups, including those with severe cardiac impairment, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with a life expectancy of less than three months. Pre-treatment laboratory values must meet specific criteria to proceed with PRRT, adding to the complexity of patient eligibility (page_label: 7).",,,,"['PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27].

The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'A positive PPQ measured before the start\nof PRRT accurately predicted the outcome of disease control after PRRT in 97% of cases,\nwhereas a negative PPQ was associated with PD after PRRT in 61% of cases at 2 months and\n89% at 6–9 months after PRRT [ 59]. Levels of the NETest, a circulating transcript analysis\nof 51 genes, during and after PRRT were found to be associated with response according\nto RECIST on imaging [ 60]. A lack of decrease in NETest levels at the fourth PRRT cycle\nsigniﬁed the advent of PD in advance of imaging, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of\n93% to predict response [61].\n4. PRRT Protocol\nThe eligibility of a patient to receive PRRT should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team\nin a specialized NET center for each individual patient. Although multiple protocols for PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE have been proposed, the most commonly used treatment schedule\nentails four cycles of 7.4 GBq177Lu-DOTATATE, which is based on the Rotterdam Erasmus\nMC protocol and also used in the NETTER-1 study [ 27,29]. The interval between cycles is\n6 to 10 weeks. In case of toxicity, this interval can be extended up to 16 weeks [ 2,3,27]. In\nparallel with the administration of177Lu-DOTATATE, an amino acid solution of 2.5% arginine\nand lysine in 1 L saline is co-infused in order to prevent renal toxicity. This infusion starts\napproximately 30–60 min before the administration of177Lu-DOTATATE with a total infusion\ntime of 4 h.

INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy. In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

Most recently, 1-amino-\n3-18F-ﬂuorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, an amino acid transport\nimaging agent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\nistration; however, its detection rate in recurrent PC is similar to\nthose of choline derivatives ( 26,27 ).\nUNMET CLINICAL NEEDS IN PC\nAccurate staging in primary PC and localization of early BCR\nfor tailoring initial and subsequent treatment strategies are un-\nmet clinical needs. Once mCRPC is diagnosed, effective therapy\nfor improving overall survival and quality of life is desperately\nneeded. Prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands are\ncurrently being investigated intensively, as they hold promise\nfor extending the frontier in PC imaging and radioligand therapy\n(RLT). This review is intended to deliver a comprehensive overview\nof current and past investigations of low-molecular-weight PSMA\nradioligands for PC imaging and t herapy. Providing insights into\npast and promising current developments regarding PSMA anti-\nbody imaging, especially targeting J591, is beyond the scope of this\nreview.\nPSMA AS TARGET FOR PC IMAGING AND THERAPY\nPSMA is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. PSMA expres-\nsion and localization in the normal human prostate are associated\nwith the cytoplasm and apical side of the epithelium surrounding\nthe prostatic ducts ( 28). PSMA is enzymatically active only in its\ndimeric form, but its function for prostate cells is still unknown\n(29). Dysplastic and neoplastic transformation of prostate tissue\nresults in the transfer of PSMA from the apical membrane to the\nluminal surface of the ducts ( 30,31 ). For several reasons, PSMA is\nan ideal target in PC.\nFirst, it is signiﬁcantly overexpressed (100–1,000 fold) on nearly\nall PC cells ( 32–35), although 5%–10% of primary PC or PC lesions\nhad negative PSMA results on PET ( 36,37 ). However, the underly-\ning etiology of PC with negative PSMA results on PET is still\nunclear, given the lack of prospective studies and correlation with\nimmunohistochemistry.\nSecond, its expression is further increased in advanced stages\nand in mCRPC ( 32,34,38 ).\nThird, after binding to the active center of the extracellular do-\nmain, PSMA ligands are internalized. Subsequent endosomal\nrecycling increases the deposition, leading to enhanced tumor uptake,\nretention, and subsequent high i mage quality for diagnostic proce-\ndures and a high local dose for therapeutic applications ( 29,39,40 ).\nPreclinical data showed that PSMA expression is independent\nof the use of taxane-based chemotherapy. This property may allow\ndirect PC imaging—an advantage over bone scintigraphy and CT\nimaging—without the “ﬂare phenomenon” ( 41). However, gene\ntranscription analysis demonstrated that androgen can suppress\nthe promoter of the PSMA gene ( 42,43 ). Therefore, the initiation\nof androgen deprivation therapy induces early but temporary upre-\ngulation of PSMA expression, downregulation under prolonged\nandrogen deprivation therapy and, ﬁnally, overexpression of PSMA\nin androgen-resistant tumors ( 44–47). A preliminary work outlined\nthis effect, which could be leveraged for improved diagnosis and\ntherapy ( 48).\nInterestingly, PSMA expression in the tumor neovasculature of\nsome solid tumors (colon, breast, kidney, and subtypes of bladdercancer) poses potential pitfalls in imaging ( 32,49 –54) but also\noffers potential opportunities for theranostic applications in can-\ncers other than PC.\nCOMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF\nPSMA LIGANDS IN CLINICAL USE\nTo date, no PSMA small molecule has been approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency.', 'Cancers 2021 ,13, 4023 2 of 17\ncancer, but nearly all patients will eventually develop castration-resistance. Despite signiﬁ-\ncant advances in systemic therapy options, the prognosis for metastatic castration-resistant\nprostate cancer (mCRPC) is poor, with overall survival under two years [2].\nProstate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein\nreceptor that is overexpressed (up to 1000 times more than normal prostate cells) in most\nprostate cancers (>90%). PSMA is normally expressed in the renal tubules and duodenum,\nin which it plays an essential role in the processing and uptake of dietary folates, and in\nthe brain, where it plays a major role in modulating the output of glutamate signaling.\nThe biological function of PSMA in prostate cancer remains elusive, although evidence\nsuggests its role in activation of PI3K-Akt signaling in prostate cancer through release of\nglutamate as messenger molecule [ 3]. The level of expression may increase with tumor\ndedifferentiation and castration resistance, although neuroendocrine prostate cancer may\nhave a decreased level of PSMA [ 4]. Even though this antigen is not entirely speciﬁc to\nprostate cancer cells, it can serve as a target for imaging and therapy due to its tumoral\noverexpression with relatively low toxicity to healthy tissues showing uptake [5].\n2. PSMA PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer\n2.1. Imaging Modalities\nMany PSMA-targeting small molecule and antibody agents have been developed and\ntested for imaging by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and\npositron emission tomography (PET). Compared to anti-PSMA antibodies, small-molecule\nPSMA inhibitors are preferable as PET imaging agents due to faster tumor uptake and more\nrapid excretion, which enhance contrast and reduce radiation exposure [ 6,7]. Currently,\nthe most developed radioligands for imaging include gallium-68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-\nPSMA-11), gallium-68-labeled PSMA-I&T (68Ga-PSMA-I&T), and ﬂuorine-18 (18F) labeled\nPSMA ligands, including18F-DCFPyL and18F-PSMA-1007. There is no consensus as\nto the optimal PSMA radioligand. Currently,68Ga-PSMA-11 and18F-DCFPyL are the\nonly FDA-approved radioligands for PSMA-targeted PET imaging in men with prostate\ncancer [8,9].\nThe ﬂuorinated agents have the advantage of a longer half-life which allows for central\nproduction and distribution over longer distances as well as lower positron energy that\ncan lead to improved imaging quality.18F-PSMA-1007 has been found to have diagnostic\naccuracy comparable to68Ga-PSMA-11 for detection of biochemically recurrent prostate\ncancer, with the advantage of minimal excretion in the urinary tract, which allows for better\ndetection of prostate bed recurrences [ 10,11]. However, cautions need to be taken when\ninterpreting18F-PSMA-1007 PET scans, as there have been reports of focal unspeciﬁc bone\nuptake, deﬁned as focal mild-to-moderate uptake (SUVmax < 10.0) not obviously related\nto a benign or malignant cause [12].\n2.2. Clinical Applications of PSMA-Targeted Imaging\nPSMA-targeted imaging has been extensively explored in primary staging and restag-\ning of prostate cancer. Conventional imaging with CT, MRI and bone scan have limited\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity for detecting occult metastatic disease, particularly in the setting\nof low PSA values [ 13]. Prospective studies have demonstrated advantage of PSMA-\ntargeted imaging in both primary staging, as well as in the biochemical recurrence setting\nin providing useful clinical information that may ultimately change management [ 14–17].\nVarious international guidelines have recommended PSMA-PET imaging to be performed\nfor the clariﬁcation of equivocal ﬁndings, particularly if the results will inﬂuence subse-\nquent treatment decisions [18,19].']"

Additionally, they are being investigated for their potential in imaging and therapy of prostate cancer (PC), particularly in extending the frontier in PC imaging and radioligand therapy (RLT) (Eiber et al., 2017).",,,,"['However, only 65.2% experienced any PSA\ndecline with only much higher percentage grade 3 thrombocytopenia of 13%, compared\nto 5.9% after ﬁrst dose.

PSMA-R2 is a urea-based PSMA-targeting small molecule inhibitor. In\npreclinical studies,177Lu-PSMA-R2 has rapid and speciﬁc uptake in mice bearing prostate\ncancer tumors, with rapid elimination through urinary system [ 72].

Notably, choline\nderivatives and18F-FDG have shown potential in assessing the\ntherapy response in mCRPC ( 24,25 ). Most recently, 1-amino-\n3-18F-ﬂuorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, an amino acid transport\nimaging agent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\nistration; however, its detection rate in recurrent PC is similar to\nthose of choline derivatives ( 26,27 ).\nUNMET CLINICAL NEEDS IN PC\nAccurate staging in primary PC and localization of early BCR\nfor tailoring initial and subsequent treatment strategies are un-\nmet clinical needs. Once mCRPC is diagnosed, effective therapy\nfor improving overall survival and quality of life is desperately\nneeded. Prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands are\ncurrently being investigated intensively, as they hold promise\nfor extending the frontier in PC imaging and radioligand therapy\n(RLT). This review is intended to deliver a comprehensive overview\nof current and past investigations of low-molecular-weight PSMA\nradioligands for PC imaging and t herapy. Providing insights into\npast and promising current developments regarding PSMA anti-\nbody imaging, especially targeting J591, is beyond the scope of this\nreview.\nPSMA AS TARGET FOR PC IMAGING AND THERAPY\nPSMA is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. PSMA expres-\nsion and localization in the normal human prostate are associated\nwith the cytoplasm and apical side of the epithelium surrounding\nthe prostatic ducts ( 28). PSMA is enzymatically active only in its\ndimeric form, but its function for prostate cells is still unknown\n(29). Dysplastic and neoplastic transformation of prostate tissue\nresults in the transfer of PSMA from the apical membrane to the\nluminal surface of the ducts ( 30,31 ). For several reasons, PSMA is\nan ideal target in PC.\nFirst, it is signiﬁcantly overexpressed (100–1,000 fold) on nearly\nall PC cells ( 32–35), although 5%–10% of primary PC or PC lesions\nhad negative PSMA results on PET ( 36,37 ). However, the underly-\ning etiology of PC with negative PSMA results on PET is still\nunclear, given the lack of prospective studies and correlation with\nimmunohistochemistry.\nSecond, its expression is further increased in advanced stages\nand in mCRPC ( 32,34,38 ).\nThird, after binding to the active center of the extracellular do-\nmain, PSMA ligands are internalized. Subsequent endosomal\nrecycling increases the deposition, leading to enhanced tumor uptake,\nretention, and subsequent high i mage quality for diagnostic proce-\ndures and a high local dose for therapeutic applications ( 29,39,40 ).\nPreclinical data showed that PSMA expression is independent\nof the use of taxane-based chemotherapy. This property may allow\ndirect PC imaging—an advantage over bone scintigraphy and CT\nimaging—without the “ﬂare phenomenon” ( 41). However, gene\ntranscription analysis demonstrated that androgen can suppress\nthe promoter of the PSMA gene ( 42,43 ). Therefore, the initiation\nof androgen deprivation therapy induces early but temporary upre-\ngulation of PSMA expression, downregulation under prolonged\nandrogen deprivation therapy and, ﬁnally, overexpression of PSMA\nin androgen-resistant tumors ( 44–47). A preliminary work outlined\nthis effect, which could be leveraged for improved diagnosis and\ntherapy ( 48).\nInterestingly, PSMA expression in the tumor neovasculature of\nsome solid tumors (colon, breast, kidney, and subtypes of bladdercancer) poses potential pitfalls in imaging ( 32,49 –54) but also\noffers potential opportunities for theranostic applications in can-\ncers other than PC.\nCOMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF\nPSMA LIGANDS IN CLINICAL USE\nTo date, no PSMA small molecule has been approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency.']"

The PROMID cohort was randomized without an obser-vation period prior to randomization; therefore, sponta-neous tumor growth was unknown. For ethical reasons, the investigators decided to avoid randomization of pa-tients with documented tumor progression to placebo treatment. In the CLARINET trial, patients with metasta-sized gastroenteropancreatic NETs and a Ki-67 prolifera-tion index <10% were randomized to lanreotide autogel or placebo. Ninety-six percent of the patients had stable disease according to RECIST in the 3–6 months before randomization. In contrast, 50% of the patients included in the PROMID trial and randomized to receive placebo were progressive after 6 months  \n[1] . TTP in the PROMID \nstudy was 14.3 months for the octreotide and 6.0 months for the placebo group. The respective figures for PFS of the midgut subgroup in the CLARINET study were much longer: ‘not reached’ in the lanreotide and 21 months in the placebo group  \n[2] . Both trials reach identical conclu-\nsions concerning the key message: long-acting soma-tostatin analogs inhibit tumor growth and prolong TTP and PFS. However, the trials markedly differ with respect to the underlying absolute figures for TTP and PFS. The use of different response criteria (the bidimensional WHO criteria vs. the unidimensional RECIST) and the inclusion of patients with different tumor biology, espe-cially the selection of patients without disease progression before randomization into the CLARINET trial, may contribute to the obvious differences found in both trials. In future studies, tumor growth behavior at study entry should be documented.\n  To conclude, this prospectively designed study pro-\nvides for the first time long-term survival data for patients with metastatic midgut NETs. The study shows that a high tumor burden is a strong indicator for a shorter sur-vival. Patients with a low tumor burden displayed a favor-able prognosis with a median survival of 107 months after randomization.

Additionally, T/N ratios of all cycles were \nevaluated (i.e. 18–24 h post-treatment 177Lu-SPECT/CT \nafter every cycle). Objective response of pre-defined target \nlesions was determined on CECT at baseline, and at 3- and \n6-months post-treatment, according to Response Evaluation \nCriteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 [18]. Target \nlesions could be a composite of multiple confluent tumours.\nSafety analysis consisted of laboratory testing (hepatic, \nrenal and haematological parameters) and recording of clini-\ncal adverse events (AEs) during all visits. Laboratory values \nwere categorized using Common Terminology Criteria for \nAdverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, and baseline labora-\ntory tests were recorded. Toxicity due to PRRT was only \nconsidered if the CTCAE grade was higher than the baseline \ntoxicity grade. Technical success rate was defined as the \nfraction of treatments allowing intra-arterial administration \nof  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE.\nAs a post hoc analysis, factors influencing tumour uptake \nwere tested against T/N results.\nRandomization and\xa0blinding\nPatients were randomized 1:1 between intra-arterial  [177Lu]\nLu-DOTATATE via the left or the right hepatic artery using \na computer-generated permuted block sequence with block \nsizes of n = 1 and n = 2. No stratification was used due to the \nsmall study sample. Patients and medical personnel were not \nblinded for the randomization result. Blinded image analysis \nfor primary and secondary endpoints was performed (i.e. \nwithout knowledge of intra-arterial treatment lobe).\nStatistical analysis\nThe minimum number of patients needed to test for a moder -\nate to large effect (i.e. a Cohen’s dz of 0·65) was calculated. \nA power of 0·9 was achieved in case of a minimum sample \nsize of 26 patients. All patients who received at least one \ncycle intra-arterially were included in statistical analysis. \nFor the primary outcome a paired samples t -test was used, \ncomparing the T/NIA against T/Ncontrol , which is equivalent \nto a one-sample t -test on the within-patient differences in \nT/N. As secondary outcome, the proportional difference in \nT/N was tested by performing a paired samples t-test on \nthe log-transformed data. Estimates (mean and 95% confi-\ndence interval (CI)) were then transformed back by taking \nthe exponent of the log-transformed estimates. Differences', 'Even data from different prospective trials are difficult \nto compare, as shown for patients included into the PRO-MID trial and the recently published CLARINET trial. The PROMID cohort was randomized without an obser-vation period prior to randomization; therefore, sponta-neous tumor growth was unknown. For ethical reasons, the investigators decided to avoid randomization of pa-tients with documented tumor progression to placebo treatment. In the CLARINET trial, patients with metasta-sized gastroenteropancreatic NETs and a Ki-67 prolifera-tion index <10% were randomized to lanreotide autogel or placebo. Ninety-six percent of the patients had stable disease according to RECIST in the 3–6 months before randomization. In contrast, 50% of the patients included in the PROMID trial and randomized to receive placebo were progressive after 6 months  \n[1] . TTP in the PROMID \nstudy was 14.3 months for the octreotide and 6.0 months for the placebo group. The respective figures for PFS of the midgut subgroup in the CLARINET study were much longer: ‘not reached’ in the lanreotide and 21 months in the placebo group  \n[2] . Both trials reach identical conclu-\nsions concerning the key message: long-acting soma-tostatin analogs inhibit tumor growth and prolong TTP and PFS. However, the trials markedly differ with respect to the underlying absolute figures for TTP and PFS. The use of different response criteria (the bidimensional WHO criteria vs. the unidimensional RECIST) and the inclusion of patients with different tumor biology, espe-cially the selection of patients without disease progression before randomization into the CLARINET trial, may contribute to the obvious differences found in both trials. In future studies, tumor growth behavior at study entry should be documented.\n  To conclude, this prospectively designed study pro-\nvides for the first time long-term survival data for patients with metastatic midgut NETs. The study shows that a high tumor burden is a strong indicator for a shorter sur-vival. Patients with a low tumor burden displayed a favor-able prognosis with a median survival of 107 months after randomization. There was a tendency for a survival ad-vantage in the group of patients with a low hepatic tumor load at the time of randomization, which was not ob-served for the whole cohort of patients treated with oc-treotide LAR.Downloaded from http://karger.com/nen/article-pdf/104/1/26/3906115/000443612.pdf by guest on 15 February 2024']"

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status.

Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control.

Daher kann keine spezifische Information über die Darstellung von PRRT-Therapien in den ESMO Guidelines aus den gegebenen Kontexten abgeleitet werden.,,,,"['ENETS Consensus Guidelines Update for \nDistant Metastatic Disease  Neuroendocrinology 2016;103:172–185 \nDOI: 10.1159/000443167181in pancreatic NET and it may be considered in G3 NET and in \nhigh-risk NET of other primary site (e.g. pulmonary NET). In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']"

Resultsfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and moleculartargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A](Figure 4 ). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm forSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.For more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 ofsupplementary Material ,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28 e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.\n99e102The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9 e23 months and OS 19 e\n53 months.

Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.Locoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.STZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400mg/m\n2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67 >10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.5-FU, 5- ﬂuorouracil; CAP , capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5- ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5- ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-\na, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, responseevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,streptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\naSlow tumour growth is de ﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nbIn liver-dominant disease.\ncIf PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\ndRapid growth is de ﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\neIn liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nfIf SSTR-positive.Annals of Oncology M.

Considering the well-known heterogeneous NET behaviour, the employment \nof PRRT in only G1 and G2 patients may exclude some G3 patients, who might derive \nbenefit from treatment. In fact, good responses to PRRT were also reported in selected \nG3 NET with lower Ki-67 (reported values of <55%).57,58 EANM Focus 3 panellists were \nin favour of extending current indication to a subset of patients with GEP G3 (NET G3, \nKi-67>20%) showing matched [18F]FDG and SSTR uptake in all lesions (based on risk, \nsymptoms, and primary tumour location).\nPanellists also agreed that patients responding to [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE may benefit from \nretreatment at disease progression, if partial remission or disease stability was obtained for \nat least one year after first administration. However, criteria to assess disease stability are not \nfully standardized and trials are lacking.\nIn patients with lesions showing heterogeneous (eg, high and low Ki67 values) grade, \ncombining PRRT with capecitabine-temozolomide (CAPTEM) has been reported, but \npanellists agreed that, based on current evidence, it should only be used within a dedicated \nprotocol considering the potential toxicity of CAPTEM in combination with PRRT.59\nPanellists were in favour of considering PRRT as first line treatment in selected cases, eg, \npatients with high tumour burden and associated symptoms.

In the clinical setting \nof heterogeneous disease and with [18F]FDG positive as the most aggressive component, no \nconsensus was reached on the feasibility of PRRT at disease progression.\nTo select candidate patients for PRRT, diagnostic nuclear medicine is mandatory \nfor confirming significant SSTR expression in tumour cells.

Normally,\nneuroendocrine cells can be either diffusely distributed in the mucosal membrane, as in the\ncase in the digestive system, or they can form organised cell clusters or organs of endocrine\nfunction, such as pancreatic islets or the pituitary gland [ 1]. Neuroendocrine cells are\nwidely distributed in the human body and, for this reason, NETs can occur in virtually any\nlocation. However, NETs occur most commonly in the GI tract, pancreas, and lungs [46].\nNETs are generally subdivided by their proliferative activity using the mitotic and/or\nKi67 index. G1 NETs are classiﬁed by <2 mitoses/10 high-power ﬁelds and a Ki-67 index\nof <3%, G2 NETs are classiﬁed by 2–20 mitoses/10 high-power ﬁelds or a Ki-67 index of\n3–20%. Well-differentiated G3 NETs are classiﬁed by >20 mitoses/10 high-power ﬁelds or a\nKi-67 index of >20%, and poorly differentiated G3 NECs are classiﬁed by >20 mitoses/10\nhigh-power ﬁelds or Ki-67 and expression alterations of p53 and Rb1 [ 1,47–49]. Further\nclassiﬁcation depends on tumour location and functionality, and it is not uniform across\ndifferent centres.\nDue to their hormonal origin, NETs can synthesise and secrete cell-type-speciﬁc pep-\ntide hormones and neuroamines, and, therefore, are characterised as functioning NETs [ 50].\nFor example, PitNETs can additionally secrete GH, PRL, or other pituitary hormones,\nthereby elevating hormone concentrations in the circulation, leading to hormonal dys-', 'ForegutLiver\nStomach\nPancreas\nSmall Intestine\nRectumLarge IntestineBone\nMidgut\nHindgutLungOesophagusThyroid\nLarge Intestine•   40 th year of commitment to the fi  eld of neuroendocrine tumors.\n•   Provide guidance to the clinician in diagnosing, monitoring, \nand treating gastroenteropancreatic tumors.\n•   Develop assays, profi  les and dynamic challenge protocols for the \nmanagement of neuroendocrine tumors.

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu). Its favorable safety pro/f_i  le \nand promising eﬃ   cacy have been demonstrated in a phase II study in 56 patients4. \nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT in metastasized GEP-NETs achieved a median PFS \nof 34.5 months in patients who received ≥2 treatment cycles (Figures 1 and 2). The \nCOMPETE trial is the /f_i  rst to undertake a direct comparison of PRRT vs. an approved \ntherapeutic.\nMethod\nTrial design\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase III \nclinical trial to evaluate the eﬃ   cacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT \ncompared to targeted molecular therapy with everolimus in patients with inoperable,  \nprogressive,  somatostatin  receptor-positive  (SSTR+)  GEP-NETs.  The  study  is  \nongoing and currently recruiting patients in at least 14 countries5.Study Objectives\nPrimary Objective\nProgression-free survival (PFS).

Therefore, we have been working closely with the Technical University of\nMunich (TUM) (https://www.tum.de/en/) on a range of projects. Over the years, ITM and its subsidiaries\nhave established GMP manufacturing and a robust global supply network of innovative, first-in-class\nmedical radioisotopes (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/) and generator platforms for\na new generation of targeted cancer diagnostics and therapies.\nIn 2007, the subsidiary ITM Medical Isotopes GmbH (formerly: ITG Isotope Technologies Garching GmbH)\nwas founded, with the aim to develop and produce diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes. In 2009, we\ndeveloped our lead product, the highly pure therapeutic radioisotope no-carrier-added Lutetium-177, for\nwhich we received marketing authorization in 2016. N.c.a. Lu is also known under the brand name\nEndolucinBeta (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/endolucinbetar-nca-177lu-\nchloride/). In 2010, the production of the new generation, non-metallic Germanium-68/Gallium-68 Generator\nproducing Gallium-68 for tumor diagnostics via molecular imaging with PET/CT/MR began. To act as a ""one\nstop shop"" in the radiopharmaceutical field, we additionally produce all the Radiolabeling & Quality Control\nEquipment (/products/radiolabeling-quality-control-equipment/) required for the use and processing of\ndiagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes, such as labeling modules and quality control solutions.\nTaking next strategic steps from being a provider of medical radioisotopes to being a biotechnology and\nradiopharmaceutical group of companies, ITM’s subsidiary ITM Solucin GmbH started an international\nPhase III Clinical Trial, known as COMPETE (https://www.itm-gep-net-trials.com/), in 2017. COMPETE is\nevaluating the efficacy and safety of Targeted Radionuclide Therapy with n.c.a.

In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

Pharm. Sci., 46, 1, 93-104, 2021Neuroendocrine tumors, which are considered to be \na slow disease, are very aggressive after they become metastatic, and especially liver metastases determine survival. Although surgical resection is recommended as a treatment option in these patient groups, many pa\n-\ntients are not suitable for this treatment method, and hepatic embolization methods are frequently used in this patient group. Besides, peptide receptor radionu\n-\nclide treatments have positive results in combination with systemic therapies used in patients with neuro\n-\nendocrine tumors, and serious toxic effects are not en -\ncountered (Ozkan, 2019). Neuroendocrine cancers are cancers that are generally seen in the intestine, stom\n-\nach, pancreas, and lung systems. Lu-177 dotatate and I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) are current\n-\nly used in the treatment of neuroendocrine cancers.\n1.2.3.1. I-131-MIBG Treatment\nI-131-MIBG is highly effective in pheochromo-\ncytoma and neuroblastoma. Also, I-131-MIBG is less \neffective in paraganglioma, carcinoid tumors, and medullary thyroid cancer. This treatment is not pre-ferred in pregnant patients. Renal functions and bone marrow reserve should be sufficient for the success of the treatment.\nRadiation affects the cells by using ß-rays emitted \nfrom the I-131 MIBG being held by neighboring cells. Therefore, isolated cells are exposed to radiation less than macroscopic tumors and cell clumps. As a re-sult, smaller tumors are exposed to radiation less, and the chance of treatment is less (Grünwald et al., 2010; Adalet et al., 2012).\n1.2.3.2. Lutetium-177 Dotatate Treatment\nLutetium-177 Dotatate is a prescribed radiophar -\nmaceutical used in the treatment of gastroenteropan-\ncreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). This ra-diopharmaceutical concentrates on the tumor struc-ture and treats the cancer with beta rays. This form of treatment is applied 4 or 5 times with an average of two months’ periods. In this treatment, critical or -\ngans such as the kidney, bone marrow, and liver are exposed to some dosage. The radiation dose in the tar -get organ is adjusted according to the maximum treat-ment dose of the treatment and the patient’s weight (Kovan, 2016).\n1.2.4. Treatment with Labeled Antibody\nRadio-labeled antibodies were first studied for tu-\nmor imaging, but with the use of F-18-FDG in pos-\nitron emission tomography, radio-labeled antibodies are no longer used for tumor detection. Later studies have shown that radiolabeled antibodies are useful in treating lymphoma (Barbet et al., 2009). Tositumom-ab, known as anti-B1, is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for the CD20 antigen expressed on normal B-lymphocytes. CD20 is described in the majority of B cell lymphomas (Press et al., 2001). This antibody inhibits tumor growth in both animal models and humans (Buchsbaum et al., 1992). Tositumomab was radiolabeled with antibody I-131 (Bexxar), and B cell Non-Hodgkins was used for treatment and was ap-proved by the FDA. Tositumomab can inhibit tumor growth in animal models and humans, but it was not developed as a human-mouse chimeric antibody. The antibody is prepared from serum-free hybridoma su-pernatants. It is radiolabeled by the method of oxida-tion of radioactive iodine with iodogen. It is commer -\ncially available, and the I-131 radiolabelled tositum-omab solution contains additives (Providon, maltose, and ascorbic acid) to limit radiolysis (Cheson, 2003; Press et al., 2001). Another FDA-approved radiophar -\nmaceutical used for B-cell Non-Hodgkins therapy is Yttrium-90-ibritumomab (Zevalin).']"

The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy.

29E naive RAG,Which isotopes are used in ITM Radiopharma's studies?,english,general,research,gpt-4-turbo naive RAG,"ITM Radiopharma's studies utilize isotopes such as 90Y, 177Lu, and 213Bi, as indicated by their use in labeling pentixather for endoradiotherapy (Gomes Marin et al., 2020).",,,,"['RG • Volume 40  Number 6  Gomes Marin et al  1719\n131I. The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy. In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed.

33E naive RAG,How does PRRT work/what is the drug made up of?,english,general,mechanism of action,gpt-4-turbo naive RAG,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) functions by utilizing radiolabeled somatostatin analogues (SSAs) that target somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

Commonly used radionuclides include lutetium-177 and yttrium-90, while octreotide and octreotate serve as ligands. The chelator, typically DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), stabilizes the complex, allowing the radiolabeled SSA to bind to the SSTRs on tumor cells.

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5.

In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Diagram provides an introductory overview of \nnuclear theranostics. Specific agents may be labeled with a \nγ-emitting radionuclide for PET/SPECT imaging, in combina -\ntion with an α- or β-particle–emitting radionuclide (suitable for \ntherapy).\ntor 2 (HER2) receptors in a breast cancer speci -\nmen to select patients who are suitable for specific \ntreatment with anti-HER2 receptor antibodies \n(eg, trastuzumab) is a well-established theranostic \napproach (7). However, in the literature, the term \ntheranostics  has been more frequently associated \nwith some in vivo nuclear medicine oncologic \napplications; this scenario exemplifies the modern \nconcept of theranostics and is the main focus of \ndiscussion in this article. Therefore, throughout \nthis article, theranostics  will be used in reference to \nnuclear medicine theranostics specifically.\nContextualization of Nuclear \nTheranostics\nNuclear medicine imaging is mainly based on \nthe principle of using radioactive isotopes linked \nto specific molecules (ie, radiopharmaceutical \nagents or radiotracers) to assess key biologic \npathways, especially the pathophysiologic features \nof diseases (8). Therapy in nuclear medicine acts \nin the same way: Radiopharmaceutical agents \nare used to target diseased tissue, with radiation \napplied at the cellular level by way of a specific \nchemical and/or biologic affinity. The imaging or \ntherapeutic capability of each radioisotope is de-\ntermined according to the type of radiation emit-\nted because electromagnetic radiation (ie, γ rays) \ncan be detected by imaging systems (scintigraphy, \nSPECT, and PET), and particulate irradiations \nhave cytotoxic (ie, therapeutic) properties (Fig 1).\nThere are two main forms of particulate radia -\ntion used for therapeutic applications: radiation \nwith α particles and radiation with β particles \n(which are electrons). These two forms of radia -\ntion share a common feature: a high transfer of \nenergy to tissues that leads to severe cellular injury \ndue to DNA damage. The α particles have higher \nenergy and much greater mass. Some isotopes (eg, \nlutetium 177 [177Lu]) can emit both electromag -comprehension, discovery, and design of drugs, \nserving as the basis of modern chemotherapy and \ntargeted therapies in medicine (2). More than \n100 years after being proposed, the magic bullet \nconcept remains current and influences the search \nand development of specific effective and harmless \nmolecule-driven treatments for human diseases, \nmost notably cancer. Recently, terms such as \npersonalized medicine, targeted medicine, and precision \nmedicine  have been used to represent this idea.\nAs a central component of patient care, imag-\ning has followed, and often made possible, dis-\ncoveries of drugs and treatments, evolving from a \nvaluable diagnostic tool to a now powerful guide \nfor enhancing disease characterization, patient \nselection, prediction of treatment response and \ntissue toxicity, and determination of the prog-\nnosis (3,4). In summary, imaging is integrated \ninto therapy now more than ever before. In this \ncontext, an approach referred to as theranostics \nhas been frequently used.
