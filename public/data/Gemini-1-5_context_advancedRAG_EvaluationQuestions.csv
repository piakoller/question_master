1G advanced RAG,Was ist der Stellenwert von PRRT innerhalb GEP-NET?,german,general,therapy,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,"PRRT hat eine antitumorale Wirksamkeit bei NETs mit einem Vorteil in Bezug auf objektive Ansprechrate und progressionsfreies Überleben. Der Evidenzgrad variiert je nach Lokalisation der Primärläsion. Die NETTER-1-Studie, eine randomisierte Phase-III-Studie, bestätigte den Stellenwert von PRRT frühzeitig bei Mitteldarm-NETs. Bei anderen Lokalisationen, insbesondere Lunge und Pankreas, sprechen trotz fehlender Daten aus kontrollierten randomisierten Studien mehrere Studien für die Wirksamkeit von PRRT und legitimieren PRRT als mögliche Option bei Patienten mit SSTR-positiven Tumoren [42,45]. Prospektive Studien sind erforderlich, um den geeigneten Zeitpunkt im Behandlungsalgorithmus im Vergleich zu anderen validierten Therapeutika bei NET (Chemotherapie, Everolimus und Sunitinib bei pankreatischen NENs) in Abhängigkeit von der Tumorlokalisation festzulegen. Eine zentrale Herausforderung bleibt die Identifizierung von Biomarkern aus Bildgebungs- und Molekulardaten, um das Ansprechen auf PRRT vorherzusagen und einen personalisierten Behandlungsplan zu erstellen.

Introduction\nNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare tumors characterized by the ability to synthe-\nsize, store, and secrete a variety of neuro-amines and peptides that can lead to secretory\nsyndrome. NETs are mainly from the digestive tract and bronchopulmonary, and their\nincidence has been steadily increasing in the last three decades [ 1]. NETs are biological and\nclinically heterogeneous. The potential for metastatic evolution and the ability to generate a\nsecretory syndrome vary considerably depending on the primary tumor location. For exam-\nple, NETs of the small intestine have a higher malignant potential while appendix or gastric\nNETs malignant are potentials are close to zero. Metastatic NETs of the midgut often secrete\nserotonin and other vasoactive substances, resulting in a typical carcinoid syndrome, mainly\ncharacterized by hot flashes, diarrhea and right valvular heart disease. More than 40% of\npatients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, which justifies the importance of a\ngood pre-therapeutic evaluation. In recent years, randomized trials validated several new\noptions such as targeted agents, including somatostatin analogues (SSA), everolimus and\nsunitinib. Since 1992, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has been developed as\na new therapeutic option in metastatic or non-resectable NET. This treatment corresponds\nto a form of systemic radiotherapy that allows targeted administration of systemic radio-\npharmaceuticals nucleides to tumor cells expressing high levels of somatostatin receptor\nJ.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']"

Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization. A key\nchallenge remains to identify biomarkers, from imaging and molecular data, to predict\nPRRT response, towards a personalized treatment plan.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., F.T., and R.C.; methodol-\nogy, B.C., A.-S.C., and R.C.; validation, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; investigation,\nB.C. and A.-S.C.; resources, B.C., A.-S.C., R.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., and F.T.; data curation, B.C. and\nA.-S.C.; writing—original draft preparation, B.C. and A.-S.C.; writing—review and editing, B.C.,\nA.-S.C., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; visualization, R.C.; supervision, RC.; project administration, R.C.

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.']"
3G advanced RAG,Welche Rolle spielt PRRT im chirurgischen Setting bei GEP-NET?,german,specific,therapy,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,PRRT kann im chirurgischen Setting bei GEP-NETs sowohl neoadjuvant als auch adjuvant eingesetzt werden. Neoadjuvant PRRT kann die Tumorgröße verringern und die Rate an kurativen Resektionen erhöhen. Adjuvante PRRT kann das Tumorwachstum nach chirurgischer Manipulation verhindern oder das weitere Wachstum bereits bestehender Mikrometastasen verhindern.,,,,"['Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 11 of 17\nof patients treated with PRRT who had mesenteric and/or peritoneal metastases ranged\nfrom 6–51% [ 27,117,118]. In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

Pancreatic NET\nIn pancreatic NETs, the effects are not conﬁrmed by a controlled randomized Phase III\nstudy (Table 2). Available data consist of multiple single-arm prospective and retrospective\ntrials. A Retrospective study series of 68 patients treated for pancreatic NET and having\nreceived four cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE at 8 GBq showed no beneﬁt in terms of survival\nin patients ( n= 35) treated with PRRT on the front line [ 21]. On the other hand, signals\nin favor of an efﬁciency are identiﬁed. In this cohort a disease control rate of 85% and a\nmedian time to progression of 34 months was observed [6].\nOther retrospective studies argue for efficacy in disease control and low toxicity of PRRT\nin pancreatic NETs. A retrospective series of 443 gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary\nneuroendocrine tumours, including 133 pancreatic NETs, showed a disease control rate of\n84% and an objective response rate of 54% in the pancreatic tumour subgroup. The median\nprogression-free survival was 30 months and overall survival was 71 months in this subgroup.\nShort-term tolerability was marked by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (related to the\nprior infusion of amino acids during the177Lu DOTATATE treatment to decrease absorption,\nand thus toxicity , in the kidney). No short-term hematotoxicity or renal toxicity was found in\nthis series. Long-term toxicity was marked by four cases of acute leukemia (0.7% of the study\npopulation) and nine cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (1.5%).

The objective response rate was\nhigher with PRRT compared to everolimus (47% vs. 12% respectively , p< 0.001), as was the\nrate of disease control (81% vs. 73% respectively, p< 0.001), and progression-free survival\n(25.7 months vs. 14.7 months respectively , p< 0.001). The tolerance profile was also better with\nPRRT than everolimus. Grade 3/4 hematotoxicity was found in 5% of cases with PRRT versus\n11% with everolimus ( p= 0.02).

5G advanced RAG,Wie viele PRRT-Behandlungen kann man bekommen?,german,specific,therapy,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,This question cannot be answered from the given context.,,,,"['Both radionuclides were used in subsets of patients \nsequentially (DUO) or in combination (TANDEM)[19, 35].\nPRRT\nThe intention to treat analysis included 1048 \npatients, who received 3692 cycles of PRRT. Most patients \nreceived a combination of 90Y and 177Lu (49%), whereas \n36% patients were only treated with 177Lu and 15% with \n90Y , exclusively. PRRT with 90Y was performed in 371 \ncycles, applying a mean activity of 3.18 GBq, whereas \nwith 177Lu was administered solely in 1043 cycles with \na mean applied activity of 6.54 GBq. Dosimetry was \nperformed after each cycle. Administered activity \ndepended on patient and tumor-related factors like weight, \nrenal function, tumor burden, clinical course and previous \ndosimetry. DUO-PRRT, i.e., application of 177Lu and 90Y \nin subsequent cycles in a particular patient, comprised \n1235 cycles with 177Lu (mean administered activity 6.55 \nGBq) and 1008 cycles with 90Y (mean activity 3.36 GBq). \nTANDEM-PRRT, i.e., treatment with a combination of \n177Lu and 90Y-labeled somatostatin analogues administered \non the same day, was performed in 35 cycles with a mean \nimplemented activity of 3.06 and 4.65 GBq, respectively.\nEfficacy and safety\nRestaging was performed with SSTR-PET/CT 3-6 \nmonths after PRRT. In case of stable disease or remission \n(complete or partial), the patient was restaged with SSTR \nPET/CT every 6-12 months until disease progression \nwas evident on imaging. In addition, MRI in selected \ncases (allergy to iodinated contrast or poor detectability \nof liver metastases on CT scan) and routine sonography \nwere performed for additional diagnostic evaluation. \nResumption of PRRT after detection of progression after \na therapy interruption of more than 6 months (2nd phase of \nPRRT) was performed in 470 patients. The next (second) \nresumption of PRRT (3rd phase of PRRT) after progression \npost 2nd phase of PRRT after an additional interval of \nmore than 6 months was implemented in 184 patients. \nLaboratory parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, \nplatelets, leucocytes, creatinine, BUN, SGOT, SGPT, \nbilirubin, SAP, TSH, SGamma-GT and respective \ntumor markers) were evaluated prior to each cycle and \nat restaging. Renal function was monitored by tubular \nextraction rate (TER) using 99mTc-MAG3 renography \nand in addition the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was \ndetermined using 99mTc-DTPA renography.\nMethod of patient documentation\nA database was established in 2004 including \nmore than 250 items for all patients with at least \none cycle of PRRT. Out of this database, items were \nextracted to allow analysis of overall and progression-\nfree survival according to age, sex, number and kind', 'The patients were divided into two groups: PRRT monotherapy ( n=81, group 1) and PRRT\nplus SSA ( n=87, group 2). The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved. Figure 1\ndemonstrates a representative case of PRRT in a neoadjuvant setting.', '[26] and Kesavan & Turner [25] reporting \nrates of 2% and 1.4%, respectively which corresponds to \nthe 2.1% in our study. Risk factors identified in our study \nwere chemotherapy and external beam radiation, as well \nas high tumor loads defined as involvement of more than \n50% of the liver, multiple/multifocal (<10) bone and \nlymph node metatases. Development of leukemia/MDS \nafter PRRT is associated with a limited mean overall \nsurvival of 14.4 months in our study. Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.']"
5E advanced RAG,How many PRRT treatments can you have?,english,specific,therapy,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,"This context does not mention the number of PRRT treatments a patient can have, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.",,,,"['In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment. Non-radiolabeled or ‘cold’ long-acting SSAs such as octreotide\nLAR and lanreotide are generally considered the ﬁrst-line systemic treatment option for\nadvanced and metastatic SSTR-positive GEP-NETs, particularly for tumors with a Ki-67\nindex below 10% [ 68]. Among the different second-line options in well-differentiated\npanNETs,177Lu-DOTATATE seems to compare favorably to targeted therapy (everolimus\nor sunitinib) or chemotherapy [ 69]. In the randomized phase II OCLURANDUM trial,\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE was associated with a higher median PFS of 20.7 months', 'The patients were divided into two groups: PRRT monotherapy ( n=81, group 1) and PRRT\nplus SSA ( n=87, group 2). The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target.

(Camus et al. 2021)",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide.

This difference in rates reported by Brieau et al. and\nthe different retrospective studies could be linked to the performing primary chemotherapy.\nThese data are in favor of PRRT treatment prior to chemotherapy.\nWhereas a blood RNA assay has been developed to predict tumour response to PRRT,\nno molecular markers have been found to predict PRRT toxicity [40].', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 8 of 17\n8.1. Hematological Toxicity\nPRRT can induce hematological toxicity through bone marrow radiation. The vast\nmajority of patients only have mild and reversible hematological toxicity with a nadir at\n4–6 weeks after administration of PRRT [ 27,36,50]. However, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,\nthrombocytopenia or leukopenia have been observed in, respectively, 1%, 2% and 1% of\nthe patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE in the NETTER-1 trial [ 27]. PRRT-induced\nsevere lymphopenia is the most common hematological toxicity [ 27,29], but it has not been\nassociated with increased susceptibility for infections [90]. Thrombocytopenia is the most\ncommon cause of dose reduction in PRRT, whereas bleeding complications are rare [ 27].\nCaution should be taken in patients with widespread bone metastases (Figure 2A), due\nto the risk of persistent cytopenia. In the absence of alternative treatment options, PRRT\nshould preferably be initiated at half the regular activity (3.7 GBq)177Lu-DOTATATE in\nthese patients. Additionally, there is a relevant long-term risk of 2% for the development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 1% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after\nPRRT [ 27,29,91]. Little is known about the pathophysiology of persistent hematological\ntoxicity, but a role for clonal hematopoiesis has been postulated [ 92]. Known risk factors\nfor severe hematological toxicity include decreased renal function, pre-existent cytopenias,\nextensive tumor mass, age over 70, extensive bone metastases and pre-treatment with\nmyelotoxic chemotherapy [ 91,93,94]. Additionally, women are at higher risk for developing\nsubacute grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia than men, which was independent from other risk\nfactors in a multivariable analysis [89].\n8.2. Nephrotoxicity\nDue to SSTR expression in the kidneys and the renal excretion of radiolabeled SSAs, the\nkidneys receive a high radiation dose during PRRT. Following glomerular filtration, SSAs are re-\nabsorbed in the proximal tubuli of the renal cortex because of active transport mechanisms [ 95].\nBy saturating this re-uptake mechanism through the use of lysine and arginine, re-absorption of\nradiolabeled peptides can be significantly reduced. This results in less radiation-induced nephro-\ntoxicity by a reduction of the absorbed kidney dose up to 40% [ 96,97]. However, nephrotoxicity\nafter PRRT still occurs such as tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy and thrombotic microan-\ngiopathy [ 98]. In the NETTER-1 study , grade ≥3 renal toxicity was observed in 5% of the\n177Lu-DOTATATE group and in 4% of the control group [ 30]. Bergsma et al. reported an overall\ncreatinine clearance loss of 3.4% 1 year after PRRT. No subacute grade ≥3 renal toxicity was\nseen and 1.5% of the patients showed grade 3 renal toxicity in the long term. However, all these\npatients had a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min at baseline [ 99]. A reduced kidney function\ncan lead to a delayed renal excretion of177Lu-DOTATATE and this has also been associated with\na higher risk of hematological toxicity [ 95]. Risk factors associated with renal toxicity include\nage > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal disease, cumulative radiation\ndose to the kidneys, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy , tumor or metastases close to the\nkidney and previous PRRT with90Y-DOTATOC [ 100]. Post-renal obstruction can be observed in\nsome GEP-NET patients, particularly in those with retroperitoneal or pelvic metastases, but this\ncan also be caused by the primary tumor, nephrolithiasis and abdominal or retroperitoneal fi-\nbrosis [ 101].']"

PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']"

Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization. A key\nchallenge remains to identify biomarkers, from imaging and molecular data, to predict\nPRRT response, towards a personalized treatment plan.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., F.T., and R.C.; methodol-\nogy, B.C., A.-S.C., and R.C.; validation, B.C., A.-S.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; investigation,\nB.C. and A.-S.C.; resources, B.C., A.-S.C., R.C., L.-J.P ., S.D., C.B., and F.T.; data curation, B.C. and\nA.-S.C.; writing—original draft preparation, B.C. and A.-S.C.; writing—review and editing, B.C.,\nA.-S.C., R.C., C.B., and F.T.; visualization, R.C.; supervision, RC.; project administration, R.C.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

9E advanced RAG,Is PRRT the future for metastatic cancer patients?,english,general,therapy,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,This question cannot be answered from the given context.,,,,"['RG • Volume 40  Number 6  Gomes Marin et al  1725\nTherefore, the NETTER-1 trial results provided \nindisputable proof of the positive effects of PRRT \nin the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and \nled to this treatment being approved by the U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration.\nThere is debate regarding the use of 90Y and/\nor 177Lu for PRRT used as single agents or in \ncombination, because preliminary studies have \nindicated that larger tumors respond better to \n90Y, whereas smaller ones respond better to 177Lu \nPRRT. Nonetheless, the actual benefit of using \na combined variant of PRRT in humans with \ngastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors \nremains unknown, although the potential efficacy \nhas been reported (47–49).\nPSMA Radioligands for Prostate Cancer\nProstate cancer is the most common noncutane -\nous cancer in males. It is the third leading cause of \ncancer deaths among men in the western hemi -\nsphere. Despite the good prognosis for individuals \nwith disease in its early stages, the prognosis is \npoor for those with metastatic disease, for whom \nthe 5-year survival rate is approximately 29% (50). \nDepending on the clinical stage of their cancer, \nup to 65% of patients may experience recurrence \nmarked by biochemical failure, with a subsequent \nhigher risk for progression to castration-resistant \nmetastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC).\nThe introduction of PSMA PET has revolu-\ntionized the evaluation of prostate cancer. The \nhigh expression of PSMA, a glycoprotein, in \nprostate cancer cells makes it an optimal imaging \ntarget. The high capability of PSMA PET for de-\npicting diminutive, previously undetected lesions \nhas been widely demonstrated in the literature \nand has led to a rethinking regarding patient \nmanagement among oncologists, urologists, and \nradiation oncologists (51).mCRPC refers to the distant spread of pros-\ntate cancer, even in patients who are being \ntreated with androgen deprivation therapy and/\nor surgical castration. It may affect up to 20% of \npatients with prostate cancer and portends a poor \nprognosis, with affected patients having an aver-\nage survival of 19 months (52). This scenario has \nprompted the development of theranostic agents \nwith molecules binding to PSMA (53), the aim \nbeing to obtain results similar to those obtained \nfor neuroendocrine neoplasms.\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The unique \nfeatures of PSMA radiotracers for assessing key \nmolecular phenotypes with higher sensitivity, \nspecificity, and target-to-background ratio facili-\ntate better diagnostic accuracy compared with \nthat achieved with the modalities previously used \nto address prostate cancer recurrence (54–56). \nThese features offer new possibilities for reduc-\ning the critical gap between recurrences that are \ndetectable with prostate-specific antigen only and \nimaging-detectable recurrences, as well as a new \nway of looking at disease spread.\nThe diagnosis of metastatic disease with use of \nPSMA PET enables detection of tumor burden \nand establishes a baseline for future response \nassessment. Moreover, it serves as a theranostic \nselector for radionuclide PSMA-based therapy \n(Fig 11) (57,58). Owing to these attributes, the \npotential of PSMA binders as imaging and thera-\npeutic agents has been extensively investigated in \nseveral centers around the world, with thousands \nof treatment cycles having been administered and \nyielding promising dosimetric, safety, and efficacy \ndata (59).\nVarious molecules that are capable of binding \nto PSMA can be used for PSMA-targeted radio-\nligand therapy (PRLT) in patients with mCRPC \nFigure 11.  Theranos -\ntic approach in a patient \nwith mCRPC who was \ntreated with several cy -\ncles of α-particle–emit -\nter 225Ac-PSMA therapy. \nA, Coronal MIP 68Ga- \nPSMA PET/CT scan \nshows high PSMA ex -\npression in many meta -\nstatic lesions, making \nthem a reachable target.', '1724  October Special Issue 2020  radiographics.rsna.org\nobservation supports targeted radionuclide therapy \nwith use of radiolabeled SSTR ligands, because no \neffective general antitumor treatment is available \nfor metastasized neuroendocrine tumors, and only \nsymptomatic relief can be achieved by using soma -\ntostatin analogs and interferon.\nThe design, choice, and implementation of \nPRRT should follow a joint clinical decision \nmade by a multidisciplinary team. Patients suit-\nable for the SSTR theranostics approach (35) \nhave SSTR-positive well-differentiated or mod-\nerately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, \nregarded as World Health Organization grade 1 \nor 2 neoplasms (36). Some authors (37,38) have \nsuggested that patients who have grade 3 tumors \nbut a Ki-67 index ranging from 20% to 50% may \nhave SSTR expression high enough to warrant \nPRRT, but more research needs to be performed \nto confirm this. PRRT is currently indicated for \npatients with metastatic or inoperable neuroen-\ndocrine tumors, especially those who experience \ndisease progression under SSTR agonists such as \nlanreotide.\nFurthermore, PRRT is associated with im -\nproved clinical symptoms and disease control \nin patients with pheochromocytomas (39) and \nparagangliomas (40)—notably head and neck \nparagangliomas—and in individuals with tumors \nrelated to succinate dehydrogenase mitochon -\ndrial enzyme gene (SDHx) mutations (SDHx-\nrelated pheochromocytomas and paraganglio -\nmas). These improvements may also be seen \nin patients with sporadic hormone-secreting \npheochromocytoma (39,41). Patients with meta -\nstatic neuroblastomas (42), medullary thyroid \ncarcinomas (43), and even recurrent meningio -\nmas (44) also may benefit from PRRT, provided they meet the key criterion for theranostics: \nimaging demonstration of radiotracer uptake by \nthe neoplastic lesions.\nMore than just an elegantly designed, tailor-\nmade molecular approach, SSTR agonist PRRT \nhas provided new hope for patients with meta-\nstatic neuroendocrine tumors. The excellent \noutcomes obtained with PRRT over the years \nhave resulted in the rapid spread of this therapy \nthroughout the world, with thousands of pa-\ntients treated and increasing numbers of studies \npublished, even before regulatory authorities ap-\nproved the use of PRRT.\nA part of the unparalleled developments in \nnuclear medicine theranostics during the past \ndecade are due to the enormous response to the \nNETTER-1 study (45), a phase 3 randomized \ncontrolled trial encompassing 41 global sites. \nThat study involved patients who had progressive \nwell-differentiated metastatic midgut neuroen-\ndocrine tumors, with SSTRs present in all target \nlesions. Individuals were randomly assigned to \nundergo treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE in \naddition to best supportive care (30 mg of long-\nacting repeatable [LAR] octreotide therapy), or \na double dose (60 mg) of LAR octreotide only. \nPRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE, as compared \nwith treatment with a double dose of LAR oc-\ntreotide, was associated with a statistically signifi-\ncant and clinically meaningful reduction (79%) \nin the risk of disease progression or death (45).\nMoreover, patients in the 177Lu-DOTATATE \narm reported prolonged maintenance of global \nhealth status, a longer time to deterioration \nacross multiple clinically relevant symptom \ncategories, and a longer period of sustained \nfunctional health–related quality of life (46). Figure 10.  Glucagon- and gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreatic tail (Ki-67 index, 5%) and hepatic metasta -\nses (Ki-67 index, 1%) in a 49-year-old man. Follow-up 177Lu-DOTATATE images demonstrate the lesions’ progressive response to the \ntheranostic treatment.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 11 of 17\nof patients treated with PRRT who had mesenteric and/or peritoneal metastases ranged\nfrom 6–51% [ 27,117,118]. In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.

Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']"

The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients.

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', '[26] and Kesavan & Turner [25] reporting \nrates of 2% and 1.4%, respectively which corresponds to \nthe 2.1% in our study. Risk factors identified in our study \nwere chemotherapy and external beam radiation, as well \nas high tumor loads defined as involvement of more than \n50% of the liver, multiple/multifocal (<10) bone and \nlymph node metatases. Development of leukemia/MDS \nafter PRRT is associated with a limited mean overall \nsurvival of 14.4 months in our study. Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.']"

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']"

Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38].

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].']"

Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization.

This\ntreatment makes use of radioactive labeled somatostatin analogues, with177Lu-DOTATATE as its\nestablished standard. PRRT has positive effects in tumor control and it lowers the risk of disease\nprogression or death. It also improves the quality of life of the patient. Unfortunately, important risk\nfactors for a minority of patients include renal and hematological toxicities. NET is a rare disease\nand treating patients with PRRT requires clinical expertise. This guide gives an overview of the\nbackground of PRRT and the current results in NET patient care.\nAbstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotate\n(177Lu-DOTATATE) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive advanced well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)\nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Clinical evidence of the efﬁcacy of PRRT in tumor control has been\nproven and lower risks of disease progression or death are seen combined with an improved quality\nof life. When appropriate patient selection is performed, PRRT is accompanied by limited risks\nfor renal and hematological toxicities. Treatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated\nclinical expertise due to the biological characteristics of PRRT and speciﬁc characteristics of NET\npatients. This review provides an overview for clinicians dealing with NET on the history, molecular\ncharacteristics, efﬁcacy, toxicity and relevant clinical speciﬁcs of PRRT.\nKeywords: peptide receptor radionuclide therapy;177Lu-DOTATATE; guide; neuroendocrine tumors\n1. Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs).', 'Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.']"

Patients suit-\nable for the SSTR theranostics approach (35) \nhave SSTR-positive well-differentiated or mod-\nerately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, \nregarded as World Health Organization grade 1 \nor 2 neoplasms (36). Some authors (37,38) have \nsuggested that patients who have grade 3 tumors \nbut a Ki-67 index ranging from 20% to 50% may \nhave SSTR expression high enough to warrant \nPRRT, but more research needs to be performed \nto confirm this. PRRT is currently indicated for \npatients with metastatic or inoperable neuroen-\ndocrine tumors, especially those who experience \ndisease progression under SSTR agonists such as \nlanreotide.\nFurthermore, PRRT is associated with im -\nproved clinical symptoms and disease control \nin patients with pheochromocytomas (39) and \nparagangliomas (40)—notably head and neck \nparagangliomas—and in individuals with tumors \nrelated to succinate dehydrogenase mitochon -\ndrial enzyme gene (SDHx) mutations (SDHx-\nrelated pheochromocytomas and paraganglio -\nmas). These improvements may also be seen \nin patients with sporadic hormone-secreting \npheochromocytoma (39,41). Patients with meta -\nstatic neuroblastomas (42), medullary thyroid \ncarcinomas (43), and even recurrent meningio -\nmas (44) also may benefit from PRRT, provided they meet the key criterion for theranostics: \nimaging demonstration of radiotracer uptake by \nthe neoplastic lesions.\nMore than just an elegantly designed, tailor-\nmade molecular approach, SSTR agonist PRRT \nhas provided new hope for patients with meta-\nstatic neuroendocrine tumors. The excellent \noutcomes obtained with PRRT over the years \nhave resulted in the rapid spread of this therapy \nthroughout the world, with thousands of pa-\ntients treated and increasing numbers of studies \npublished, even before regulatory authorities ap-\nproved the use of PRRT.\nA part of the unparalleled developments in \nnuclear medicine theranostics during the past \ndecade are due to the enormous response to the \nNETTER-1 study (45), a phase 3 randomized \ncontrolled trial encompassing 41 global sites. \nThat study involved patients who had progressive \nwell-differentiated metastatic midgut neuroen-\ndocrine tumors, with SSTRs present in all target \nlesions. Individuals were randomly assigned to \nundergo treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE in \naddition to best supportive care (30 mg of long-\nacting repeatable [LAR] octreotide therapy), or \na double dose (60 mg) of LAR octreotide only. \nPRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE, as compared \nwith treatment with a double dose of LAR oc-\ntreotide, was associated with a statistically signifi-\ncant and clinically meaningful reduction (79%) \nin the risk of disease progression or death (45).\nMoreover, patients in the 177Lu-DOTATATE \narm reported prolonged maintenance of global \nhealth status, a longer time to deterioration \nacross multiple clinically relevant symptom \ncategories, and a longer period of sustained \nfunctional health–related quality of life (46).

Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease.

PRRT had the highest probability (96%)\nof being the most effective treatment in terms of improving PFS and posing a low risk of\nSAEs based on cluster ranking [129].\nOnly SSTR agonists have been labelled with beta-emitters thus far. SSTR antagonists\nare expected to have a higher afﬁnity for somatostatin-positive tumour cells, resulting in\nan increase in the radiation dose delivered to the tumour. Another intriguing approach\nis to use alpha emitters such as Bismuth-213 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n245 min) or\nActinium-225 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n210 d) as a targeted alpha particle therapy (TAT).\nTAT treatment has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the treatment of the\ncastration-resistant prostate cancer-expressing 177Luprostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen.\nThe advantage, it has been hypothesized, is a shallow tissue penetration depth combined']"

In a retrospective study of 132 NET patients with a mesenteric\nmass,177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in an ORR of this mass in only 4% of the patients [ 119].\nIn an analysis of NET patients with mesenteric or peritoneal disease, 23% of patients at\nhigh risk for complications experienced at least one episode of bowel obstruction within\nthree months of PRRT. These patients were treated with corticosteroids, surgery and total\nparenteral nutrition [ 117]. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established,\ntreating physicians should be aware that PRRT seems to be ineffective in reducing the size\nof a mesenteric mass while there may be an increased risk of abdominal complications\nin patients with extensive peritoneal disease or desmoplastic changes associated with\nmesenteric metastases. A post-infusion trial of corticosteroids can be considered in patients\nat high risk of these complications [117].\n12. Conclusions and Future Directions\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is a widely applicable therapy for patients with ad-\nvanced and metastatic NETs. It is clear that PRRT contributes to reduction of tumor growth\nand stabilization of the disease in a signiﬁcant proportion of these patients. Next, PRRT\nimproves QOL and reduces symptoms [ 27,29]. Despite the successes, it is important that\nclinicians treating NET patients are aware of the toxicities (mainly renal and hematological)\nassociated with PRRT and discuss every patient in a multidisciplinary team where careful\nselection, preparation and management of these patients before and during therapy with\nthis unique radiopharmaceutical can be discussed. Despites its successes, there still is\nroom for improvement of the efﬁcacy and safety of PRRT. Ongoing research projects are\nexploring how to improve the current strategies. A combination therapy with radiosen-\nsitizers is a way to increase the effect of PRRT. This can be conducted by the inhibition\nof poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 which is essential for the repair of SSBs [ 120]\nor inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone molecule that plays a role in\ncell protection and maintenance [ 121]. Other radionuclides are being studied for poten-\ntial use in PRRT, such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213. These alpha-emitting\nradionuclides can potentially cause more damage to the tumor cells compared to PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE and thus increase treatment efﬁcacy [ 122–124]. Altogether, PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE is a very potent treatment modality for patients with progressive\nwell-differentiated (grade 1–2) GEP-NET and there are many different strategies currently\nbeing explored that can contribute even to better patient care.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.B., J.N. and J.H.; writing—original draft preparation,\nM.N.B.; writing—review and editing, N.S.M., W.W.d.H., T.B., J.N. and J.H.; supervision, J.N. and J.H.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Oncode Institute (grant number P2019-0035).\nConﬂicts of Interest: T.B. has received speaker fees and research support from AAA/Novartis and is\non the advisory board, as well as speaker fees from Ipsen.

(Camus et al., 2021)",,,,"['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 12 of 15\n5. Perspectives, Ongoing Studies\nThe role of PRRT in NETs is evolving. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and\nwill probably consolidate PRRT: in GEP-NETs versus other standard of care treatment such\nas Everolimus (Compete trial), in Pan-NET versus Sunitinib [ 41] and in G2–G3 NETs as\nupfront treatment versus Octreotide LAR [42].\nSome new strategies are also under investigation: combination with chemotherapy\n(ex: with Capecitabine for aggressive FDG-positive G1–G3 GEP-NETs), using new thera-\nnostics agents (SS-Antagonist) and alpha-PRRT [ 43]. Intra-arterial administration has been\nalso proposed and could be combined with intravenous administrations, as tested in a\nphase 1 trial for patients with liver-dominant metastatic pancreatic NETs by Bodei and\ncolleagues [44].\n6. Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs. In other localizations, speciﬁcally lung and pancreas,\nalthough data from controlled randomized trials are lacking, several studies argue for the\neffectiveness of the PRRT legitimating PRRT as a possible option in patients with SSTR-\npositive tumors [ 42,45]. Prospective studies are needed to establish the appropriate timing\nin the treatment algorithm vs the others validated therapeutics in NET (chemotherapy,\neverolimus and sunitinib for pancreatic NENs), depending on tumor localization.

17E advanced RAG,Which radiopharmaceutical drugs are approved by the FDA?,english,specific,medication,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,"This context does not mention which radiopharmaceutical drugs are approved by the FDA, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.",,,,"['94\nAkgün, Özgenç, GündoğduINTRODUCTION\nRadiation is the condition of atoms breaking down \nspontaneously by emitting energy to make them more \nstable. The heavy nucleus of atoms is unstable because of their high energy amount and try to become stable \nto abandon this situation. This situation is called ra-\ndioactivity or radioactive degradation (Asikoglu et al., \n2017). Radioactivity is substantial in radiopharmacy \nstudies. Radiopharmacy is a significant part of phar -\nmacy, concerned with the preparation, distribution, and administration of radioactive drugs. The develop-ment of radiopharmacy has also been begun with the discovery of radiation (Asikoglu et al., 2017; Kovan, 2016; Ozer, 2004).\nRadiopharmaceuticals are drugs and used for the \ndiagnosis and treatment of diseases (Silindir Gunay, \n2020). They can be administered to patients safely. In nuclear medicine applications, 95% of radiopharma-ceuticals are used for diagnosis, and 5% for treatment. \nThe radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnosis emit \ngamma (γ)-ray, and the radiopharmaceuticals used \nin treatment emit alpha (α) and beta (ß) particles \n(Asikoglu et al., 2017; Henkin et al., 2006). The main features of radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnosis or treatment are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. The features of radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnosis or treatment (Asikoglu et al., 2017).\nDiagnosis Treatment\nRadioisotopes These should emit γ and β+ rays These should emit α and ß- rays\nEnergy 150 KeV on average Medium/high energy (>1MeV)\nEffective half life 1,5 x test time Hour/day\nLocalization High in the target organ High in the target organ\nRadiation dose Low dose, high efficiency Effective dose\nFinding Easy and cheap Easy and cheap\nQuality control Easy Easy\nNuclear medicine is an area of medicine and has \na significant role in the diagnosis, and treatment of \nmany diseases. With nuclear medicine imaging stud-ies, medical problems can be identified at an early stage and treatment can also be provided using ra-diopharmaceuticals. In nuclear medicine, radiophar -maceuticals show therapeutic efficiency by destroying the target cells in the tissue with radiation  (Kovan, 2016; Sivri et al., 2004).  Radiopharmaceuticals used for diagnosis and treatment in nuclear medicine are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Also, Indi-\num-111 (In-111) Octreotide therapy and, In-111 Oc-\ntreotide scintigraphy, I-131 MIBG therapy and I-131 \nMIBG scintigraphy, Lu-177 DOTA therapy, and Lu-\n177 DOTA scintigraphy are examples of this group \n(Durak, 2015; Srivastava, 2012).\nSimilar Diagnostic and Therapeutic Molecules \nExamples for this group are imaging with Tech-\nnetium-99m (Tc-99m)-MDP or Tc-99m-HDP , treat-\nment with Re-186-HEDP , or Sm-153-EDTMP , and imaging with Ga-68-DOTA and treatment with Lu-177 or Y-90 DOTA peptides (Srivastava, 2012).\nDue to the different electron configurations of \nradionuclides, chemical and biochemical features, molecular stability, and biological behavior of radio-\npharmaceuticals can differ, but similar behavior is ex-\npected for these molecules (Durak, 2015).\nDifferent Diagnostic and Therapeutic Molecules, \nBut Similar Effect Mechanism \nThe treatment with the Y-90 microsphere, imag-\ning with Tc-99m MAA in liver cancer, can be given as the most common sample of this group. Although the \nmolecules are entirely different from each other, the \nbehavior is similar (Durak, 2015).\nCONCLUSION\nThe selection of suitable radionuclides is essential \nin any therapeutic radiopharmaceutical development. \nTheir nuclear emission characteristics, physical half-life, \ndegradation properties effect in vivo pharmacokinet -\nics, cost, and availability of the radiopharmaceuticals. Also, types of particle emission affect the distribution \nand pharmacokinetics of the radiopharmaceuticals. For \ntherapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, radionuclides that degrade by α-particle, B-particle, and Auger-electron \nemission are commonly used in the preparation.\nIn this review article, information about the radio\n-\npharmaceuticals used in the treatment is given. Today, \na limited number of radiopharmaceuticals are routine -\nly used in the treatment of many diseases. In the past ten years, clinical studies have been focused on radio\n-\nimmunotherapy. Studies on radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies and radiolabeled receptor binding agents \nare being conducted. Few studies have achieved their goal so far and are currently used in treatment. The best results have been achieved in treating lymphomas, and two FDA-approved radiopharmaceuticals are used in practice. Radiopharmaceutical science is an emerging research field that meets the clinical standards. They have an essential therapy index and high imaging abil\n-\nity. The scientific community examines various radio -\nnuclides, pharmaceutical agents, radiopharmaceuticals, and evaluating in vivo performance of newly developed radiopharmacauticals. Thus, great efforts are being made to develop new radiopharmaceuticals to be con\n-\nverted into clinical research to treat many diseases. As detailed in this review, most of the current studies focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of radio\n-\npharmaceuticals. We believe that these developments will have positively affects on human life and lead to positive results in the diagnosis and therapy of patients.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of \ninterest.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTION STATEMENTDeveloping hypothesis (Gundogdu E.)  prepar -\ning the study text (Akgun E., Ozgenc E.) reviewing \nthe text (Gundogdu E., Ozgenc E.) literature research (Akgun E., Ozgenc E.)\nREFERENCES\nAdalet, A.

Prostate-\nspeciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is a promising target for\nboth imaging and therapy. In this review paper, we provide an overview of the evidence for PSMA-\ntargeted imaging in prostate cancer, focusing on different imaging modalities and their theranostic\napplications. We will also review PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy, focusing on lutetium-177\nradioligand therapy and alpha-emitting radioligand therapy with actinium-225. Combination reg-\nimens with lutetium-177 and other systemic therapy agents will be reviewed. Antibody-based\nradioimmunotherapy will also be discussed along with other noteworthy radionuclide agents.\nAbstract: Introduction: Prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising novel molecular\ntarget for imaging diagnostics and therapeutics (theranostics). There has been a growing body of\nevidence supporting PSMA theranostics approaches in optimizing the management of prostate\ncancer and potentially altering its natural history. Methods: We utilized PubMed and Google Scholar\nfor published studies, and clinicaltrials.gov for planned, ongoing, and completed clinical trials in\nPSMA theranostics as of June 2021. We presented evolving evidence for various PSMA-targeted\nradiopharmaceutical agents in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer, as well as combination\ntreatment strategies with other targeted therapy and immunotherapy. We highlighted the emerging\nevidence of PSMA and ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT as a predictive biomarker for PSMA\nradioligand therapy. We identiﬁed seven ongoing clinical trials in oligometastatic-directed therapy\nusing PSMA PET imaging.']"

The control group received octreotide LAR alone administered intramuscularly at a dose of 60 mg every 4 weeks.', 'Pa -\ntients were required to have a Karnofsky perfor -\nmance-status score of at least 60 (on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower numbers indicating greater disability), a tumor with well-differenti -\nated histologic features, and somatostatin recep -\ntors present on all target lesions (as confirmed by blinded, independent central review). Well-differentiated histologic features were defined as a Ki67 index (the percentage of cells that are positive for Ki67 as determined by immunos -\ntaining of the primary tumor) of 20% or less; tumors were assessed as low-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 0 to 2%, intermediate-grade if they had a Ki67 index of 3 to 20%, or high-grade if they had a Ki67 index of greater than 20%, with a lower grade indicating a lower rate of prolifera -\ntive activity. Target lesions were selected from CT or MRI, and the degree of expression of soma -\ntostatin receptors was determined on the basis of the lesion that had the highest uptake of radio -\ntracer observed on planar somatostatin receptor scintigraphy within 24 weeks before randomiza -\ntion. All CT and MRI images were reviewed and evaluated for disease progression (according to RECIST criteria) and somatostatin receptor ex -\npression by independent central reviewers who were unaware of the treatment assignments.\nKey exclusion criteria were a serum creatinine \nlevel of more than 150 μmol per liter (1.7 mg per deciliter) or a creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml per minute; a hemoglobin level of less than 8.0 g per deciliter; a white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter; a platelet count of less than 75,000 per cubic millimeter; a total bilirubin level of more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range; a serum albumin level of more than 3.0 g per deciliter, unless the prothrombin time value was within the normal range; treatment with more than 30 mg of octreo -\ntide LAR within 12 weeks before randomization; peptide receptor radionuclide therapy at any time \nThe New England Journal of Medicine\nDownloaded from nejm.org on April 15, 2024.

Recommendations are given according to the best availableevidence and authors' experience and will have a level of evidence\n(1–5) and strength of recommendation (A –D) (Table\n2) as per the\nGRADE system.1\nThe incidence of Pan-NET is rising, most recently reported as\n0.48 per 100,000 new cases per year according to the Surveillance,\nEpidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Programme; although Pan-NET\ncarry an unfavourable prognosis compared to NET from other primarysites, an improvement in overall survival (OS) has been observed over\ntime (median OS of 3.6 years), particularly in patients with distant\nmetastases.\n2\nThe majority (between 50% and 85%) of Pan-NET are nonfunc-\ntioning. Moreover, NF-Pan-NET tend to present with more advanced\ndisease (more advanced tumour [T]-stage, lymph node involvementand liver metastases) and arise in the head of the pancreas. Conse-\nquently, patients with NF-Pan-NET have a significantly worse OS than\ntheir functioning counterparts ( p< .001).\n3,4\nIn patients undergoing curative resection, a shorter survival\nwas observed in patients with NF-Pan-NET, lymphatic invasion,\nand size >10 cm, while a shorter disease-free survival (DFS)\nwas associated with advanced pT-stage (pT3 –4), size >5 cm and\nhistological grade (G) 2 –3. Ki-67 > 10% predicted a poorer\nprognosis.52|DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 |Q1. How should we define and characterise a\nNF-Pan-NET at presentation?\nWhile the diagnosis of functionality relies on the presence of a\nhormonal syndrome, the NET-diagnosis relies on histological or cyto-\nlogical analysis. Histopathological diagnosis is based on the neuroen-docrine growth pattern, including nesting, trabecular, gyriform and\nsolid architecture, as well as the expression of neuroendocrine\nmarkers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A (CgA).\n6It should\nbe noted that in the pancreas, especially acinic cell carcinoma, solidpseudopapillary neoplasm and paraganglioma can be positive for\nthese markers, and therefore they should be actively excluded.\n7More\nrecently, the transcription factor INSM1 has emerged as a both sensi-tive and specific diagnostic mar ker of NET. Grading is assessed by\nTABLE 1 Ten major questions on management of nonfunctioning\npancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\nQ1 How should we define and characterise a NF-Pan-NET\npatient at clinical presentation?\nQ2 Which biochemical tests should be performed in a patient\nwith NF-Pan-NET?\nQ3 Which is the most suitable imaging work-up for NF-Pan-NET\npatients?\nQ4 What is the appropriate surgical management of NF-Pan-\nNET?\nQ5 What is the role of PRRT in patiente with NF-Pan-NET?Q6 What is the role of biotherapy and molecular targeted\ntherapies in patients with advanced NF-Pan-NET?\nQ7 What is the role of chemotherapy in patients with advanced\nNF-Pan-NET?\nQ8 In the setting of advanced disease, which is the most suitable\nfirst-line systemic therapy? Which sequence of treatments\nshould be used?\nQ9 Is there a specific work-up in MEN1-associated NF-Pan-NET\npatients?\nQ10 What is the recommended follow-up in NF-Pan-NET\npatients?TABLE 2 Level of evidence and strength of recommendations."", 'Neuroendocrinology. \n2016;103(2):119-124.\n15.

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status. Variation of treatment choices will also depend on physician exper-tise, the complexity of the treatment center and access to novel treatments. Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control. In some patients, it may be necessary to combine therapies for example to suppress symptoms using SSA in addition to locoregion-al therapies or other antiproliferative agents. \n  Locoregional Therapies \n In the absence of any large comparative trials of dif-\nferent locoregional or ablative therapies (bland embo-lization, chemoembolization, radioembolization, radio-frequency ablation or microwave destruction) or system-ic treatment, the choice of treatment is based on individual patient features (e.g. size, distribution and  Table 1.

Despite the large body of\nevidence regarding efficacy and clinical safety, PRRNT is still\nconsidered an investigational treatment and its implementationmust comply with national legislation, and ethical guidelines\nconcerning human therapeutic investigations. This guidance\nwas formulated based on recent literature and leading experts ’\nopinions. It covers the rationale, indications and contraindica-\ntions for PRRNT, assessment of treatment response and patient\nfollow-up. This document is aimed at guiding nuclearmedicine specialists in selecting likely candidates to receive\nPRRNT and to deliver the treatment in a safe and effective\nmanner.

This\nguidance document was compiled taking into accountrecent literature and experts ’opinion.\nRegulatory issues\nApplicable in all countries Clinicians involved in unsealed\nsource therapy must be knowledgeable about and compliant\nwith all applicable national and local legislation and\nregulations.\nApplicable in the USA The radiopharmaceuticals used for\nthe diagnostic and therapeutic procedures addressed in thisguidance document are not approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) in the USA. Therefore in the USA\nthese procedures should be performed only by physiciansenrolled in an investigational protocol pursuant to a valid\nInvestigational New Drug application or Radioactive Drug\nResearch Committee approval and under the purview of anappropriate institutional review board.\nBackground information and definitions\nDefinitionsPRRNT PRRNT (or PRRT) involves the systemic\nadministration of a specific well-definedradiopharmaceutical composed of a β-\nemitting radionuclide chelated to a pep-\ntide for the purpose of delivering cyto-toxic radiation to a tumour. The\noligopeptides are designed to target cel-\nlular proteins, commonly cell surfacereceptors, such as the somatostatin recep-\ntor (sstr) subtype 2 (sstr2) that is overex-\npressed on the cell surface of NETs in atumour-specific fashion, thereby ensuring\na high level of specificity in the delivery\nof the radiation to the tumour. Hence,PRRNT is a molecularly targeted radia-\ntion therapy, and thus is distinct from ex-\nternal beam radiation therapy.\nSomatostatin The naturally occurring somatostatin\nmolecule is an oligopeptide comprising\neither 14 or 28 amino acids with alimited half-life in blood due to rapid\nenzymatic degradation. Somatostatin\nexerts an antisecretory endocrine andexocrine effect in addition to tumour\ncell-growth inhibition. Stabilized ana-\nlogues of somatostatin (SSA) showprolonged duration of action [ 1].\nSomatostatin\nreceptorsIn humans five sstr subtypes have been\nidentified. Each sstr is a transmembranemolecule weighing approximately\n80 kDa. Somatostatin exerts its action by\ninhibiting G-protein-dependent 3 ′,5′-\ncyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation\nin a dose-dependent manner atsubnanomolar concentrations. Sstr2 is\noverexpressed in NETs.']"

27G advanced RAG,Was war das mediane PFS in der Netter-2 Studie?,german,specific,study,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,This question cannot be answered from the given context.,,,,"['Other regimens \ninclude FOLFIRI, FOLFOX and CapTem. In terms of Iri-\nnotecan-5FU-based regimens, the ORR ranges from 17 to \n40%, PFS 4–5.8\xa0months and OS 5–11\xa0months [120– 122]. \nFor Oxaliplatin-5FU, PR ranges from 23 to 29%, PFS \n4.5\xa0months and OS 9.9\xa0months [123– 125]. CapeTem has also demonstrated activity in this setting [113]. However, \npatients with Ki-67 > 55% have worse outcomes [126]. \nThe SEcond-line therapy in NEuroendocrine CArcino-\nmas (SENECA) phase II study is evaluating FOLFIRI \nor CAPTEM post failure of first-line chemotherapy in \npatients with lung and NEC [127].\nPRRT is an option, as G3NETs have the greater propen-\nsity for SSTR expression relative to NECs: its utility here \nhas been reported by several small studies [31, 128– 130, \n131 ••]. In the largest series reported (N  = 69 G3NET/\nNEC), the median PFS was 9.6\xa0months, and the median OS \nwas 19.9\xa0months; for patients with Ki-67 ≤ 55% (n  = 53), \nthe median PFS was 11\xa0months and OS 22\xa0months, for \nthose with Ki-67 > 55% (n  = 11), 4\xa0months and 7\xa0months, \nrespectively [31]. An analysis of 4 studies where PRRT \nwas used in the second/third line setting: overall PFS was \n19\xa0months in G3NET, 11\xa0months for NEC (Ki-67 ≤ 55%) \nand 4\xa0months for NEC (Ki-67 > 55%) [131 ••]. Thus, \nPRRT may be considered for patients in G3 NENs with \nKi-67 < 55% [31, 131••]. Current trials include the phase \nIII COMPOSE study of 177Lu-DOTANOC versus sys-\ntemic therapy (NCT04919226) and the NETTER-2 phase \nIII trial randomising patients to PRRT versus high dose \nSSA (NCT03972488). PRRT is being combined with \nNivolumab (NCT04525638).\nICI is also promising in progressive high-grade NET \nand NEC, based on their higher TMB; the latter is greater \nin NECs and with microsatellite instability noted in 14% of \nNECs [132]. A meta-analysis of 10 heterogenous, single-\narm studies of ICI in NEN ( N = 464) found a pooled ORR \nof 15.5% [133). The response was based on primary site: \nwith thoracic NEN being more likely to respond than GEP-\nNEN (ORR 24.7% vs 9.5% respectively) and well-differ -\nentiated tumours having a lower response rate than NECs \n(ORR 10.4% vs 22.7% respectively) [133]. Very limited \nactivity has been observed with single-agent immuno-\ntherapy [134, 135], relative to combined PD1 and CTL4 \nblockade. From the CA209-538 study, 29 patients with \nheavily pre-treated NETs were treated with a combination \nof ipilimumab and nivolumab. Overall, in the 13 (45%) \nwith high-grade disease, the ORR was 24% and a DCR of \n72% [136 ••]. The SWOG S1609 DART trial reported the \nresults of the high-grade G3 NET/NEC cohort (N  = 19) \nwith a median Ki-67 value of 80%. The ORR was 26% \nand the clinical benefit rate (stable disease for ≥ 6\xa0months \nplus PR and CR) was 32% [137 ••].', 'Articles1760  www.thelancet.com/oncology   Vol 22   December 2021midgut NETs.23,24 In this study, our prespecified final \noverall survival analysis, with a median duration of \nfollow \xadup of more than 6 ·3 years in each group, showed \nthat overall survival did not differ significantly between \nthe study groups (HR 0·84 [95% CI 0·60–1·17]; two \xadsided \np=0·30). Long \xadterm survival analysis in this indolent \ntumour type is challenging because of the extended \nsurvival, potential for crossover to investigational treatment, and the use of other subsequent therapeutic options. For example, phase 3 trials of somatostatin analogues in similar patient populations have not shown a benefit with these agents in terms of overall survival, \ndespite highly significant improvements in progression \xad\nfree survival.7,8,26 In NETTER \xad1, median overall survival \nwas 48·0 months in the ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate group and \n36·3 months in the control group. Despite final overall survival not reaching statistical significance, the 11·\n7\xadmonth difference in median overall survival with \n¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate might be considered clinically relevant. \nAdditionally, at the time of this final analysis, no new safety signals had emerged, reaffirming the previously \nreported safety profile of ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate.\nA limitation of this analysis is that during long \xadterm \nfollow \xadup, 36% of patients in the control group received \nPRRT as subsequent treatment (primarily ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate). \nMost of these patients received PRRT early during long \xad\nterm follow \xadup (23% by 24 months after randomisation). \nThe overall HR was adjusted to account for this crossover \nto PRRT, using the rank \xadpreserving structural failure \ntime approach. The method assumed a constant treatment effect regardless of when PRRT was received and adjusted the survival of patients who crossed over. The adjusted HR of 0 ·73 suggests that crossover to PRRT \ncontributed to the overall survival results in the control group. However, other confounding factors clearly existed, which is another limitation of this analysis, including other subsequent anticancer treatments (24% patients received further antineoplastic agents); extended survival in a large subpopulation of patients regardless of their randomly assigned treatment (more than 35% of patients in each group survived for 5 years); and missing data (20% of patients were censored because \nof consent withdrawal or loss to follow \xadup).\nThe Cox regression analysis of treatment effect based \non overall time \xadto\xadevent comparison between the \ntwo groups requires the proportional \xadhazards assumption \nto be met. However, the proportional \xadhazards assumption \nfor the Cox analysis of overall survival was not fulfilled in this trial. Therefore, we did a restricted mean survival time analysis, which does not require hazards to be proportional and can complement conventional statistical approaches. Restricted mean survival time was longer in \nthe ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate group than in the control group at all \nprespecified yearly time points, suggesting that, on \naverage, patients survived longer with ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate \nthan with high \xaddose long \xadacting octreotide over the \nentirety of a 5 \xadyear period.\nOverall survival was consistent across most prespecified \nsubgroups, including regardless of age, sex, tumour grade (grade 1 or grade 2), and previous treatments. Interpretation of subgroup trends based on hazard ratios \nis restricted by the presence of non \xadproportional hazards. \nHowever, the finding of greater overall survival benefit \nwith ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate versus control treatment in patients \nwith a low baseline Karnofsky performance status score of 60–80 (HR 0 ·45 [95% CI 0 ·26–0·78]) is \nsupported by observed restricted mean survival time \nextension at the 2 \xadyear timepoint, which suggests a \nsurvival benefit with ¹⁷⁷Lu \xadDotatate treatment in patients \nat high risk with a shorter life expectancy, in particular those with a low Karnofsky score.']"

Therefore, we have been working closely with the Technical University of\nMunich (TUM) (https://www.tum.de/en/) on a range of projects. Over the years, ITM and its subsidiaries\nhave established GMP manufacturing and a robust global supply network of innovative, first-in-class\nmedical radioisotopes (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/) and generator platforms for\na new generation of targeted cancer diagnostics and therapies.\nIn 2007, the subsidiary ITM Medical Isotopes GmbH (formerly: ITG Isotope Technologies Garching GmbH)\nwas founded, with the aim to develop and produce diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes. In 2009, we\ndeveloped our lead product, the highly pure therapeutic radioisotope no-carrier-added Lutetium-177, for\nwhich we received marketing authorization in 2016. N.c.a. Lu is also known under the brand name\nEndolucinBeta (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/endolucinbetar-nca-177lu-\nchloride/). In 2010, the production of the new generation, non-metallic Germanium-68/Gallium-68 Generator\nproducing Gallium-68 for tumor diagnostics via molecular imaging with PET/CT/MR began. To act as a ""one\nstop shop"" in the radiopharmaceutical field, we additionally produce all the Radiolabeling & Quality Control\nEquipment (/products/radiolabeling-quality-control-equipment/) required for the use and processing of\ndiagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes, such as labeling modules and quality control solutions.\nTaking next strategic steps from being a provider of medical radioisotopes to being a biotechnology and\nradiopharmaceutical group of companies, ITM’s subsidiary ITM Solucin GmbH started an international\nPhase III Clinical Trial, known as COMPETE (https://www.itm-gep-net-trials.com/), in 2017. COMPETE is\nevaluating the efficacy and safety of Targeted Radionuclide Therapy with n.c.a. Lu-Edotreotide\n(/pipeline/itm-11-for-neuroendocrine-tumors-gep-nets/), a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for the treatment\nof gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) based on EndolucinBeta, compared to the\nstandard therapy.\nHistory & Milestones\n177\n®\n177\n®', 'About Targeted Radionuclide Therapy  \nTargeted Radionuclide Therapy is an emerging class of cancer therapeutics, which seeks to deliver \nradiation directly to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to normal tissue. Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

34G advanced RAG,Was ist die wichtigste Voraussetzung für die Behandlung mit PRRT?,german,general,requirements,gemini-1.5-pro-latest advanced RAG,Eine relativ normale Nierenfunktion (glomeruläre Filtrationsrate > 50 ml/min) (Camus et al. 2021),,,,"['PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', '&A patient with pending liver failure should be consid-\nered with caution before being submitted to PRRNT.\nProcedure\nPretherapy assessment\nThe availability of the following information is mandatory\nwhen considering a patient for PRRNT:\n&NET proven by histopathology (immunohistochemistry).\n&High sstr expression determined by functional whole-\nbody imaging with111In-pentetreotide (OctreoScan) or68\nGa-DOTA-peptide PET/CT or immunohistochemistry.\nThe following criteria should be taken into consideration\nwhen deciding whether or not to perform PRRNT.\n&Karnofsky/Lansky performance status above 60 % or\nECOG performance status less than 2.\n&Tumour differentiation, preferably grade 1/2.\n&Tumour proliferation rate, preferably with a Ki-67/mitotic\nindex ≤20 %. In addition, the rate of tumour growth, as\ndetermined by CTor MRI, could be considered. Note that,in general, less-differentiated tumours showing high pro-\nliferation rates are better candidates for chemotherapy.\nFacility and personnel\nPRRNT is still considered an investigational treatment and\nits implementation must comply with national legislation\nand local requirements, as well as with ethical principles\nregarding human studies. The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart. Administration concomitant\npositively charged aminoacids (lysine or arginine) is systematically carried out and reduces\nPRRT induced renal toxicity. The realization of PRRT requires a relatively normal renal\nfunction (glomerular ﬁltration rate > 50 mL/min), a positive SSTR-based imaging (at least\none grade 2 absorption according to Krenning’s score corresponding to equal or greater\nabsorption to normal liver parenchyma) and normal medullary function.']"

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'protective measures are undertaken.

The\noligopeptides are designed to target cel-\nlular proteins, commonly cell surfacereceptors, such as the somatostatin recep-\ntor (sstr) subtype 2 (sstr2) that is overex-\npressed on the cell surface of NETs in atumour-specific fashion, thereby ensuring\na high level of specificity in the delivery\nof the radiation to the tumour. Hence,PRRNT is a molecularly targeted radia-\ntion therapy, and thus is distinct from ex-\nternal beam radiation therapy.\nSomatostatin The naturally occurring somatostatin\nmolecule is an oligopeptide comprising\neither 14 or 28 amino acids with alimited half-life in blood due to rapid\nenzymatic degradation. Somatostatin\nexerts an antisecretory endocrine andexocrine effect in addition to tumour\ncell-growth inhibition. Stabilized ana-\nlogues of somatostatin (SSA) showprolonged duration of action [ 1].\nSomatostatin\nreceptorsIn humans five sstr subtypes have been\nidentified. Each sstr is a transmembranemolecule weighing approximately\n80 kDa. Somatostatin exerts its action by\ninhibiting G-protein-dependent 3 ′,5′-\ncyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation\nin a dose-dependent manner atsubnanomolar concentrations. Sstr2 is\noverexpressed in NETs.']"

However, in the literature, the term \ntheranostics  has been more frequently associated \nwith some in vivo nuclear medicine oncologic \napplications; this scenario exemplifies the modern \nconcept of theranostics and is the main focus of \ndiscussion in this article. Therefore, throughout \nthis article, theranostics  will be used in reference to \nnuclear medicine theranostics specifically.\nContextualization of Nuclear \nTheranostics\nNuclear medicine imaging is mainly based on \nthe principle of using radioactive isotopes linked \nto specific molecules (ie, radiopharmaceutical \nagents or radiotracers) to assess key biologic \npathways, especially the pathophysiologic features \nof diseases (8). Therapy in nuclear medicine acts \nin the same way: Radiopharmaceutical agents \nare used to target diseased tissue, with radiation \napplied at the cellular level by way of a specific \nchemical and/or biologic affinity. The imaging or \ntherapeutic capability of each radioisotope is de-\ntermined according to the type of radiation emit-\nted because electromagnetic radiation (ie, γ rays) \ncan be detected by imaging systems (scintigraphy, \nSPECT, and PET), and particulate irradiations \nhave cytotoxic (ie, therapeutic) properties (Fig 1).\nThere are two main forms of particulate radia -\ntion used for therapeutic applications: radiation \nwith α particles and radiation with β particles \n(which are electrons). These two forms of radia -\ntion share a common feature: a high transfer of \nenergy to tissues that leads to severe cellular injury \ndue to DNA damage. The α particles have higher \nenergy and much greater mass. Some isotopes (eg, \nlutetium 177 [177Lu]) can emit both electromag -comprehension, discovery, and design of drugs, \nserving as the basis of modern chemotherapy and \ntargeted therapies in medicine (2). More than \n100 years after being proposed, the magic bullet \nconcept remains current and influences the search \nand development of specific effective and harmless \nmolecule-driven treatments for human diseases, \nmost notably cancer. Recently, terms such as \npersonalized medicine, targeted medicine, and precision \nmedicine  have been used to represent this idea.\nAs a central component of patient care, imag-\ning has followed, and often made possible, dis-\ncoveries of drugs and treatments, evolving from a \nvaluable diagnostic tool to a now powerful guide \nfor enhancing disease characterization, patient \nselection, prediction of treatment response and \ntissue toxicity, and determination of the prog-\nnosis (3,4). In summary, imaging is integrated \ninto therapy now more than ever before. In this \ncontext, an approach referred to as theranostics \nhas been frequently used.
